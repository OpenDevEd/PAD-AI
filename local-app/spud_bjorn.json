    "Abstract (AB)": "This study examines the initial experiences of immigrant teachers from Kenya, Africa, as they adapt to the Southern California classroom. It specifically explores their encounters with classroom discipline issues in their initial years of teaching in the USA. The study involves 35 immigrant teachers from Kenya with a teaching experience in elementary, middle or high school in Southern California. Three major data collection methods are utilized: a questionnaire, interviews and case studies. Thirty-five teachers respond to a three-part questionnaire. Ten of these participate in an interview process that explores in detail their teaching experiences in both Kenya and the USA, and their perceptions of classroom discipline issues. Finally, classrooms of three case study participants are observed; these are further interviewed, and documents from their schools are reviewed. Major findings from the study reveal that these teachers face challenges that are based on the differences between the Kenyan and USA cultures. Because mainstream American culture encourages freedom of speech, discussion, and equality, some students tend to be talkative and assertive in the classroom, and do not appear to respect teachers. In Kenya students are comparably quieter, less assertive and display respect for their teachers. Most of these immigrant teachers do not receive adequate formal assistance from schools and school districts. They depend on books and peers to understand school policies and procedures, and they rely on their previous experience to fashion classroom management strategies. Furthermore, they feel that some parents are neither supportive of teachers nor involved in their children's lives at home or at school. Despite the many challenges, these teachers are resilient; open to change, use self-initiative to learn about their classrooms, foster quality work and behavior, and show professional growth. New immigrant teachers can benefit from induction programs that focus on their specific needs and introduce them to school cultures. They also need administrative and parental support. Initial years for these teachers should not be seen merely as a time of survival but of professional growth and development.

    "Abstract (AB)": "The first section of the book deals with the theoretical implications of globalization on education and social development in Africa. For the last three decades, many African countries have suffered major crises resulting in high levels of unemployment, poverty, and lack of social development, all of which have been worsened by the AIDS pandemic. The authors, such as [Ali A. Abdi], boldly argue that the condition of Africa is not due to lack of policies, but rather policy failure in education and social development. The authors call for a reexamination and recasting of educational goals, a \"counter hegemonic framework\" in this era of globalization. The colonizing process has erased African culture and has deprived the African people of their Indigenous knowledges and continues to do so in the form of globalization and neocolonialism. This erasure has brought about a decline in employment, education, and social development, and an increase in poverty and personal risks to the African people. It is time to re-culture Africa, and re-indigenize African schooling, knowledges, and methodologies.\\n\\n              \\nTwo chapters by [Puplampu] and Tettey focus on the problems of higher education in Africa. Puplampu describes the dire consequences of the commodification of knowledge and academic capitalism that Africa is now facing. The problem of higher education is intensified in Africa by the lack of monetary resources and a mass exodus of professionals and intellectuals. The objectives of the multinationals to put profit before the good of the society are creating dilemmas for African governments. They wonder how to balance the needs of society with the need for funds to run tertiary institutions. Multinational companies want to fund and carry out studies in areas that are not necessarily in the best interest of the larger society. But the need for money is so great that governments allow such studies to take place. Science and technology receive more attention than the social sciences, much to the detriment of the continent.\\n\\n              \\nSouth Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, and Swaziland have their own challenges. I liked how Foison looks at the correlation between education and economic growth, the relationship between education and work in Ghana. This shows that critical thinking about the relationships between jobs, education, and economy is occurring and the hope in finding the right solution for Africa is underway. People are moving beyond the blame game to finding concrete solutions. The same can be said about Swaziland. Kwansah-Aidoo and Djokoto look at the effectiveness of the Swaziland school system: teacher evaluations, student repetition, and dropout rates, analyzing the relationship between output of education to the investments made in education. The authors make many suggestions about improving the system to enable the country to participate fully in the global market. As a means of comparison, it would also be interesting to know how the other countries discussed have fared in the global market.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Distance education as a complementary mode of delivery of education was initiated as an effort to overcome the challenges of access, equity, cost-effectiveness and quality for higher education. Due to the shortage of teachers and the failure of existing teacher education colleges to increase the matriculation of teachers, Ghana, like many other developing countries, relies on distance education to augment traditional face-to-face method of teacher education.    The study used an adaptation of Provus' Discrepancy Evaluation Model to evaluate a distance teacher education program in the University of Cape Coast, the primary teacher education institution in Ghana. The study involved comparing performance data of the program to standards prepared from the program's design, and the standards of the Association for the Development of Education in Africa (2004). Performance data was obtained by administering two survey instruments to a random sample of students and faculty/administrators. Discrepancy between performance and standards were reported.    The study concluded that, although there were some discrepancies between program standards and performance, the program is fulfilling its purpose of upgrading the professional and academic performance of a large number of teachers in the public K-8 schools in Ghana.",

Factors related to attendance and school completion; teachers and teaching; quality of learning; strategic planning, policy and school development are discussed. A positive outcome of this study was that students, teachers and other professionals freely discussed issues concerning the impact of the HIV and AIDS epidemic on education in a context where such issues are commonly met with silence or denial.

    "Abstract (AB)": "This study was designed to investigate the relationship of teacher education faculty members' attitudes and their perceptions of technology professional development needs with faculty technology use for teaching and learning in two Ghanaian tertiary teacher education institutions. The study was based on Rogers' (1995) Diffusion of Innovations (DoI) theory, the Concerns Based Adoption Model (CBAM) of Hall and Hord (1987), and Ely's (1999) conditions for educational technology innovations as theoretical frameworks.   The study used survey methodology supplemented by interviews. The quantitative data were analyzed using multiple regression. Participants in the study were 132 faculty members of the University of Education, Winneba and the Faculty of Education of the University of Cape Coast, both Ghanaian teacher education institutions. The faculty technology survey consisted of 65 items factored into five factors.   The results showed that: (i)&#xa0;faculty perceptions of the effects of technology use on pedagogy and students' learning, (ii)&#xa0;faculty perceptions of barriers and challenges to the adoption and use of technology for teaching and learning, and (iii)&#xa0;faculty motivation for adoption of instructional technology made unique significant contributions to explaining faculty use of technology for teaching and learning.   According to the interviews and responses to an open-ended question on the survey, this study also found that the contextual conditions that facilitate educational technology innovations were not met in the two participating universities. The majority (55.7%) of participants were at the non-adopter stages of technology adoption, based on the CBAM stages of adoption survey.   The study offered faculty members an opportunity to voice their concerns and views concerning their institutions' technology integration programs. The findings could inform university management about technology decisions to promote the use of instructional technology among faculty members.   A major limitation of this study was the use of non-randomized sample which limits the generalization of the findings to these particular Ghanian institutions at a particular point in time.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Background\\nThere is an emerging corpus of work on the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on education in sub-Saharan Africa. This mainly employs demographic models to make projections of student enrolments and teacher requirements. However, there is a paucity of research in basic schools to examine the experiences of AIDS-affected teachers and students.\\nPurpose\\nThis study explored staff and student perceptions of the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on the education of affected children in high-prevalence districts of the Copperbelt province of Zambia. The impact of the epidemic on student enrolment, attendance and completion rates, and on the quality of the learning experience, was investigated.\\nProgramme description and sample\\nThe Ministry of Education assisted with the selection of districts in the Copperbelt Province with the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS (34% to 39%). Four government schools with the highest HIV/AIDS prevalence rates and two community schools in impoverished communities were selected.\\nDesign and methods\\nStatistical data from each school were made available. Six focus groups were held with District Education Board Personnel, NUT officials and the Copperbelt Special Education Standards Officer. Six interviews were held with school management teams. A total of 72 teachers and 64 students responded to questionnaires; 36 students also took part in four focus groups, each involving gender balanced groups of six to eight students from grades 4-8.\\nResults\\nThe study provides information on the impact of the epidemic on basic education that has not previously been documented in Zambia and may assist the strategic planning and management of basic schools. A positive outcome of this study was that students, teachers and other professionals freely discussed issues concerning HIV/AIDS and its impact on education in a context where such issues are usually met with silence or denial.\\nConclusions\\nThe challenge for the Zambian Ministry of Education and the international community is not only to provide the right to basic education, but also to strengthen schools as inclusive and supportive communities. For students, this might focus on provision of alternative and more flexible opportunities for participation and learning, access to health and life skills education and appropriate counselling and support. For teachers, professional development opportunities to support the management of large classes and curriculum development - e. g. in the areas of life skills and vocational skills - are implicated.\\n",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Background There is an emerging corpus of work on the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on education in sub-Saharan Africa. This mainly employs demographic models to make projections of student enrolments and teacher requirements. However, there is a paucity of research in basic schools to examine the experiences of AIDS-affected teachers and students. Purpose This study explored staff and student perceptions of the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on the education of affected children in high-prevalence districts of the Copperbelt province of Zambia. The impact of the epidemic on student enrolment, attendance and completion rates, and on the quality of the learning experience, was investigated. Programme description and sample The Ministry of Education assisted with the selection of districts in the Copperbelt Province with the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS (34% to 39%). Four government schools with the highest HIV/AIDS prevalence rates and two community schools in impoverished communities were selected. Design and methods Statistical data from each school were made available. Six focus groups were held with District Education Board Personnel, NUT officials and the Copperbelt Special Education Standards Officer. Six interviews were held with school management teams. A total of 72 teachers and 64 students responded to questionnaires; 36 students also took part in four focus groups, each involving gender balanced groups of six to eight students from grades 4-8. Results The study provides information on the impact of the epidemic on basic education that has not previously been documented in Zambia and may assist the strategic planning and management of basic schools. A positive outcome of this study was that students, teachers and other professionals freely discussed issues concerning HIV/AIDS and its impact on education in a context where such issues are usually met with silence or denial. Conclusions The challenge for the Zambian Ministry of Education and the international community is not only to provide the right to basic education, but also to strengthen schools as inclusive and supportive communities. For students, this might focus on provision of alternative and more flexible opportunities for participation and learning, access to health and life skills education and appropriate counselling and support. For teachers, professional development opportunities to support the management of large classes and curriculum development-e.g. in the areas of life skills and vocational skills-are implicated.

    "Abstract (AB)": "This integrative review on the teaching of reading in Kenyan primary schools provides a foundation for the growing movement there to improve reading education. In gathering sources for this review, we took an inclusive historical stance. Thus, we did not dismiss research reports that lacked traditional indicators of quality such as being published in peer-reviewed journals. We used multiple methods to find relevant research and associated documents, including two trips to Kenya. The review is organized by six topics: (a) language of instruction, (b) reading instruction, (c) reading materials, (d) reading culture, (e) assessment, and (f) teacher development. The review concludes with six proposals for policymakers, educational researchers, and teacher educators for the development of reading instruction based on what we learned in reviewing the literature. The first proposals are intended specifically to address the teaching of reading in Kenya, but they may be relevant to other sub-Saharan nations. The final proposal encourages others to conduct similar reviews to make possible a handbook of reading in Africa.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The paper demonstrates that a majority of the students with disabilities in Ghanaian classrooms (in Accra and some rural areas in Eastern Region) did not have their disabilities detected or identified by professionals. The paper also shows that vision impairment is the most common problem reported by the teachers in the schools, especially in Accra. Also, most of the teachers did not have any training in teaching children with disabilities. This situation limits their capability of helping the children with disabilities meaningfully toward achieving their educational goals. The study also demonstrates that some teachers were not happy to have children with disabilities, especially those with behavior problems, because of their large classes. It is recommended that the Ghana Education Service makes Special Education courses a major component in the teacher-training curriculum in Ghana, and also appoints experts on children with developmental problems to organize workshops for teachers in order to increase teacher effectiveness in dealing with children with disabilities. (Contains 4 figures.)",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The need to provide quality and affordable housing to Ghanaian professionals, including teachers, doctors, nurses, university professors have led the government to explore different alternative investment options in the housing sector. Given the government's embrace of World Bank-supported neo-liberal economic policies, it is not surprising that it opted to shift from government-support and provision approach to a private sector-led housing policy. One visible result of this policy shift is the emergence of private real estate companies in many major cities. This study discusses the effectiveness of past housing policies and the increasing role of the private sector in the housing industry. Using questionnaire survey with real estate companies in Accra, the study examines the problems facing the industry and whether membership of Ghana Real Estate Developers Association has any effect on companies' ability to provide housing for professionals. The study calls for more government regulation in this emerging industry.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Greetings Dear readers of TOJDE, I am pleased to inform you that in the 8th year of TOJDE are appeared on your screen now as Volume 8, Number: 4. Ti is the last issue of the year 2007. As you volume ( Number 3 was the special issue of TOJDE on “Web 2.0 and Social Software in Distance Education” subject. I received many congrulation for this special issue from the subject expert and TOJDE readers. During 6 months I received more than 45 submissions. Some of them rejected by me for the reason that their subjects were not fit for TOJDE’s publishing content strategy, and some of them rejected by TOJDE’s editors. And others can be publish next year’s issues In this issue we published one notes for Editor, 13 articles, already one review (maybe I can update for one or two reviews in due course which I am waiting from my book reviewers), news and announcements for our readers. This time 24 authors from eighth different countries are placed in this issue. These published articles are from Australia, Gana, Indonesia, Malaysia,  Nigeria, Pakistan, Turkey, and UK.  The first article of this issue is coming from Faculty of Education, Monash University, Victoria, AUSTRALIA. Article is entitled as “Globalization, Distance Education And Hegemonic Futures” and written by Dr. Glenn RUSSELL. He says in his paper that “Available options for distance educators can be understood in terms of instrumental and interpersonal axes that can potentially indicate the relative consideration that can be given to these factors. This approach is suggested as one way to understand available options at a time when there has been an apparent increase in instrumental approaches to distance education at the expense of interpersonal approaches and issues of social justice. While this problem is of concern, it is more appropriate to reflect on the unintended consequences of distance education for society and identify them than it is to uncritically oppose globalisation and its adherents” and discusse Distance education; globalisation; instrumentalism; null curriculum   hegemony, Second article is from India and it is dealt with “Science Education Through Open And Distance Learning At Higher Education Level”, written by Dr. Amrita NIGAM and Dr. Vibha JOSHI from Indira Gandhi National Open University, INDIA. This paper examines an attempt to study the experiences of the open science learners of IGNOU on different aspect of the science higher education. Here a questionnaire was used to collect the data and responses from 81 students enrolled for B. Sc. from IGNOU were collected. The findings of the study reported that society has undergone drastic changes in the last few decades. The revolution led due to Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have widely affected all aspects of society. The emerging jobs require entirely new skills and competencies i.e., employment in BPOs or switching over to e-governance, e-Banking and e- based sectors. Even e-learning has made numerous expectations from teachers and other personnel. The use of ICTs in almost every field needs adequately trained workers so that they can work efficiently and effectively. The training and retraining avenues in the conventional system is grossly inadequate to cope up with the present and future demands. In this situation open and distance education is the available alternative. In the third article is about “Attidues of Graduate Students Toward Distance Education, Educational Technologies And Independent Learning”, written by Dr. Ozana URAL. Elementary Education Department, Atatürk Faculty of Education University of Marmara, TURKEY. She discusse in her paper the views of the doctoral students at traditional universities on the use of distance education systems and technologies and independent learning are determined. Findings indicate that doctoral students do not have a positive attitude towards the use of distance education systems and technologies, and they do not agree with the idea that distance education systems can support independent learning.  The 4th articles arrived from Universitas Terbuka, INDONESIA, on “A Provision Of Student Learning Support Services In A Large-Scale Distance Education System At Universitas Terbuka, Indonesia”, which is written by Aminudin ZUHAIRI, Irma ADNAN and Dina THAIB. This paper addresses the practice and experience of Universitas Terbuka (UT) in the provision of learning support services for students in a large-scale distance education system. The UT, which has a network of 37 regional offices and participating institutions, has challenges to provide and manage effective learning support system for more than 340,000 students, residing in various locations of Indonesia, a country with diverse level of the quality in terms of transportation, communication and technological infrastructure and facilities.  The fifth article came from GANA, the subject is “Wıdenıng Access To Tertıary Educatıon For Women In Ghana Through Dıstance Educatıon”, written by Olivia Adwoa Tiwaah Frimpong KWAPONG, University of Ghana, Institute of Adult Education. This paper explores the unique nature of DE for widening access to tertiary education most especially for women in Ghana and the issues to consider in the process.by the baseon women, ICTs, distance education, tertiary education cohcepts. The sixth article which is entitled as “REMOTE RF LABORATORY REQUIREMENTS: Engineers’ and Technicians’ Perspective”, written by Dr. Nergiz Ercil CAGILTAY, Dr.  Elif  Uray AYDIN and Dr. Ali KARA from Atilim University, Ankara, TURKEY This study aims to find out requirements and needs to be fulfilled in developing remote Radio Frequency (RF) laboratory. Remote laboratories are newly emerging solutions for better supporting of e-learning platforms and for increasing their efficiency and effectiveness in technical education. By this way, modern universities aim to provide lifelong learning environments to extend their education for a wider area and support learners anytime and anywhere when they need help.  However, as far as the authors concern, there is no study investigating the requirements and needs of remote laboratories in that particular field in the literature. This study is based on electrical engineers’ and technicians’ perspectives on the requirements of a remote laboratory in RF domain. Its scope covers investigation of the participants’ perceptions toward computer mediated communication and it attempts to answer the questions: which studying strategies are preferred by the learners and what kind of RF laboratory content should be provided.  The analysis of the results showed that, geographic independence, finding quickly the elements of past communication and temporal independence are declared as the most important advantages of computer-mediated communication.The seventh article is came from again Indira Gandhi National Open University, INDIA, on “Knowledge Management & Its Applications In Distance Education” subject written by Anurag SAXENA. I remember that he had written an article to TOJDE many years ago  He hdeclares in his paper that Knowledge management (KM) can provide a university with an opportunity to integrate processes, facilitate collaboration, and form relationship across traditional organizational boundaries. It no longer stands that the most knowledgeable only will conquer; it has become that one who actually uses that knowledge will get the edge. KM provides the opportunities to rethink, recast and re-engineer. Present communication tries to build a framework for open universities to effectively use KM to maintain relationships with existing students and attracting new students, build high-valued knowledge assets, build a knowledge based value-chain to respond to the changing demands for education.  The 8th article is arrived to us MALAYSIA. The article which is entitled “THE NEED FOR PARTICIPATION IN OPEN AND DISTANCE EDUCATION: The Open University Malaysia Experience”, which written by Santhi RAGHAVAN Faculty of Business & Management and P. Rajesh KUMAR from Faculty of Science Open University Malaysia,MALAYSIA. Their paper provides an overview of adult learner participation in open and distance education by focusing participation needs based on selected socio-demographic variables such as age, years of working experience and monthly income. The related study involved a sample of 454 Open University Malaysia students from a number of learning centres located in different parts of the country. The study found that adult learners are generally below the age of 39, relatively not affluent, have less than 20 years of work experience and have a high need for participation. The highest need is professional advancement, followed closely by cognitive interest, and communication improvement while the lowest reported need is escapism/social stimulation. Age and work experience exhibited negative regression coefficients, indicating inverse associations with participation need. These results are comparable to the findings of previous research on the role of age, work experience and monthly income as factors determining participation in adult higher education. Next and the ninth article were sent to TOJDE by Dr. Muhammad Imran YOUSUFfrom University of Arid Agriculture, PAKISTAN. Title of paper is “Effectiveness Of Mobile Learning In Distance Education”.  The main aim of his research is to better understand and measure students’ attitudes and perceptions towards the importance of mobile learning in distance education. Results of this survey clearly indicate that facilitating mobile learning can improve the entire distance education by enhancing ways of communication among distance learners, tutors and supporting staff. The biggest advantage of this technology is that it can be used anywhere, anytime and its usage is easy access to a larger number of distance learners. This study draws the preferences and the extant to which distance learners in Pakistan are use to mobile learning.  The tenth article is written by four Nigerian academics from Covenant University  Paper is titled as “The Prospects Of E-Examination Implementation In Nigeria” and written by Ayo C. K.,  Akinyemi I.O.,  Adebiyi A. A., Ekong U.O. This paper propose of this paper is looking for a model for e-Examination in Nigeria where all applicants are subjected to online entrance examination as a way of curbing the irregularities as proposed by the Joint Admissions Matriculation Board (JAMB), the body saddled with the responsibility of conducting entrance examinations into all the Nigerian universities. This model was designed and tested in Covenant University, one of the private universities in Nigeria. There were 120 questions drawn from English (30), Mathematics (30), General Science (20), Commercial Courses (20), and Religion Knowledge (20), all for one hour duration. Questionnaires were administered to the applicants at the end of the examination to assess their level of ICT literacy, ease of use of the system and the difficulties encountered. Findings revealed that the system has the potentials to eliminate some of the problems that are associated with the traditional methods of examination such as impersonation and other forms of examination malpractices. The system is easy to use and candidates can get use to it with time. The timing of examination can be spaced without compromising the quality and integrity of the examination. However, much is still desired if the system were to be adopted on a national scale, particularly in terms of infrastructural and manpower development. Similarly, the quest for e-Examination can fast track the development of e-Learning facilities in the country with improved access to education.  The eleventh article is written by Qadir BUKHSH, Lecturer, Department of Education The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan on “Empowerment Of Women Through Distance Education In Pakistan”. The presented study was undertaken to highlight the gender disparities of Pakistan as well as at regional and international level. The study, measured the comparative outcome of formal and non-formal system of education in Pakistan. To achieve the desired goal, documentary analysis was considered appropriate. The number of schools and enrollment during the years 2001 to 2004 of the formal system for primary, middle and high level was considered and enrollment during the year 198-1999 and 2004 for Secondary School Certificate to Ph.D level of non-formal system was considered. Data was analyzed in term of percentage and average. It was found that enrollment of female is less than male in formal system while enrollment of female is higher than male in non-formal system of education in Pakistan. Next article is which numbered as 12, from again PAKISTAN.USA. Article is entitled as “A Study Of Student’s Attitude Towards Distance Teacher Education Programme In Pakistan”, written by Aijaz Ahmed GUJJAR, Lecturer, Federal College of Education, Muhammad Akhlaque Trained Under Graduate Teacher Federal Government Secondary School and Muhammad Rashid HAFEEZ Lecturer, Federal College of Education, Islamabad & Doctoral Scholar Department of English Bahauddin Zakariya University. The presented study was undertaken to measure the attitude of the students towards teacher training programmes through Distance Education offered by Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU), Islamabad, Pakistan. To achieve the said end, the descriptive method of research was considered appropriate. The population of the study consisted of the B. Ed. Students of AIOU.  Three hundred students from the Sahiwal region were selected as sample for the study. Questionnaire was used as a Research tool to gather the relevant data. Data was analysed in terms of percentage and mean score.  It was found that majority of the students appreciated the overall input of the programme though a few eyebrows were raised concerning the assessment of the assignmentsThe thirteenth and the last article is from Anadolu University, TURKEY,  which is written by Dr. Ergun TUNCKAN entiled as STRUCTURAL DIMENSIONS AND FUNCTIONS OF STUDENT CENTERS IN THE OPEN EDUCATION FACULTY PRACTICES:Three Metropolis Sampling - Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir”. His paper tells The Open Education Faculty Students Centers have been offering many services to students in Turkey since 1982. Building up bridges between students and faculties; student’s centers have had technological improvements since 1998 and thereafter quality of services have been increased and services given to students at the student’s center have been variated by implementing a low-cost computer network. Operations of the student’s centers in The Open Education system, modifications taking place in the automation systems of the centers and qualifications of services given to students have been examined comprehensively in this article. I this issue already I am giving a place only one reviewing. This is CASES ON GLOBAL E-LEARNING PRACTICES: Successes and Pitfalls, edited by Sharma, R. C., & Mishra, S. (Eds.). Hershey, PA: Information Science Publishing. (ISBN 1-59904-340-8). And reviewed by Yavuz Akbulut, from Anadolu University, TURKEY. The book properly serves to the objective of providing learning opportunities through a set of case studies on e-learning application in different contexts.  Practical experience and research-based information have been synthesized meticulously in almost all chapters. Except for slight deviations from the accepted format of the book and except for slight ambiguities stemming from language use, most parts are reader friendly. Moreover, the readers are able to locate relevant information checking specific headings and abstracts all of which are organized effectively.  Thus, the book might also serve as a reference book to be used whenever and wherever it is necessary to ameliorate reflection in action. The conclusion section of the book is particularly helpful in understanding the guidelines on how to plan, design and implement e-learning. Besides, the section groups the guidelines into six subcategories each one sheltering insightful reflections.  Practitioners who are interested in e-learning practices will be able to find invaluable information in this book all of which results from reflective practice. Thus, the book might really help the readers gain insights into what makes an e-learning endeavor effective along with successes and pitfalls regarding practices in question.  In the other sections are again in the same format as usual as TOJDE’s presenting style. News and some announcements are placed in this issue too.Dear readers, you can reach us online either directly at http://tojde.anadolu.edu.tr or by visiting Anadolu University homepage at http://www.anadolu.edu.tr from English version, clicking on Scientific Research button and than go to the Referred Journals.

    "Abstract (AB)": "Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine issues of quality and quality assurance in Kenyan schools, identify reasons why Kenya government has difficulties in achieving its well documented search for quality education and to trace the process for ensuring the accountability of teachers in Kenya. This focus is done under conditions of significant changes in government policies and educational restructuring. Design/methodology/approach - The reflections are done through a review of variety of research and analytical sources. Findings - The review shows that the government, whose approach has been ambivalent and paradoxical, has determined teacher accountability and that the underlying cause of poor quality education in Kenya's schools is not the performance of teachers per se but deeply rooted management practices and other government policies which will have to change if this dream is to be realized. The evaluation of teachers' work should not be separated from development since quality is dependent on professional development. There is no development without challenge and quality development depends on the participation of all persons involved in teaching and learning. Practical implications - The most obvious practical implication of this paper is that education in Kenya needs complete overhaul and not piecemeal reforms. Above all, there is need to invest regularly in the development of teachers, as teachers need access to continuous and effective updating and updating systems. Originality/value - This paper provides an opportunity for reflection and builds a foundation on some of the key challenges that face education and teachers in Kenya. The paper suggests directions for leading Kenyan schools into a successful future. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "For schools to perform well there is need for the creation of good relations both within the school and also between the school and the neighborhood, stakeholders of education must feel free to interact and work with schools, high level of discipline, persistent evaluation, monitoring and supervision of academic progress, and continued professional development of teachers. Thus for any leadership in the school to realize any school improvement, efforts should be put forward to ensure the availability of such contributing factors as mentioned. The National curriculum in Kenya is uniform and expects to meet all the academic needs of students in secondary schools for good performance and improvement irrespective of where they come from and the surrounding learning environment schools find themselves. The problem for rural schools particularly, Gucha district, the area of target for this study has been persistent poor performance and the main area that has been the subject of contention is poor headship in Schools. The problem that has caused public outcry both parents, the government and the whole nation at large has been how to improve the role of headteachers in school and possibly develop strategies to facilitate this and consequently improve the general school performance. The research literature has long promoted the promotion democratic leadership where teachers and students are given freedom of speech and expression without any intimidation from headteachers, encouragement of teachers' professional development to help teachers acquire new teaching methods and be motivated to work, the use of student -based teaching methods, development of good and strategic relationships both in and outside Schools, and involvement of stakeholders in all that appertains to the running of school programs as those are the people are directly affected by the school. The study made use of the interview schedules as the main instrument of data collection and a questionnaire as a supplement to collect data. Analysis of data was descriptive and presented in tables, percentages and graphs. It was established from research findings that lack of effective interaction between the school administration and the rest of the members both in school and outside the school were the leading factor for poor school performance, followed by low monitoring and supervision of the teaching and learning processes in the school and many other factors. A total sample of 18 participants was involved in the exercise of data collection and all of them were purposively selected. The writer argues that having the right perception and knowledge on the role of a headteacher, its influence on school performance, and understanding the role of other stakeholders of education on school improvement could provide a vehicle for improving the role of secondary school headteachers and definitely boost academic performances in Schools. Strategies are suggested to help both education policy makers, the government, education agencies and schools develop effective headship strategies to effectively run the schools and consequently boost the level of performance.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The purpose of this study is to construct an African Music and Dance Interdisciplinary Curriculum for American Middle Schools. Questions addressed while developing this Multicultural Music Education Curriculum model are: the philosophy underlying multicultural music education in the United States; the type of knowledge gained through multicultural music education; how this knowledge can be made relevant to the middle school student, teacher, parents, and the larger society; ways of integrating African music into multicultural music education programs in American middle schools; support needed for teachers who teach African music in American middle school classrooms; and how the knowledge gained through the study of African music can be evaluated to ascertain its validity and usefulness. In developing this African Music Curriculum model, the present state of multicultural music education in America, with particular reference to the work of the Music Educators National Conference, professional documents from seminars and conferences on multicultural music education, books, periodicals and research reports, were gathered and reviewed. Then, the literature on philosophical foundations of curriculum development from the perspectives of social constructivism, phenomenology, experimentalism, and developmentalism, African music as subject matter, the African society, and the middle school learner were discussed. Tyler's rationale formed the organizational structure for the overall curriculum. The curriculum model included purposes of the African music and dance as part of music education programs in American middle schools, Educational Experiences, Organization of Educational Experiences, Evaluation Procedures, and a Teaching Unit using B[open o]b[open o][open o]b[open o], a Social music and Dance of the E[upsilon]edomeawo of Ghana, and was based on individual needs, interests, and capabilities of the American middle school learner. The content of the B[open o]b[open o][open o]b[open o] unit was focused on four areas: Appreciation Activities, Drumming Activities, Singing Activities, and Movement and Dance Activities. The instructional and learning activities incorporate a variety of audio and visual materials. The need to realize individual differences among the learners gave room for variety of learning activities, learning materials and evaluation procedures.

    "Abstract (AB)": "Today's English language teaching goes beyond the norms of English spoken and taught in native-English-speaking countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, or Australia. Increasingly, a variety of countries have established, formally or informally, a kind of English unique to their own populations, and English language teachers within those countries receive training in this particular variety of English. In \"Global English Teaching and Teacher Education: Praxis and Possibility\", contributors use field studies and research to examine the increasingly global role of English language teaching and teacher education. Contributions from Asian countries such as Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, and Korea to Ghana in Africa and to the European contexts of Germany, Spain, and Turkey display a variety of historical and theoretical perspectives on the roles and status of differing Englishes across societies. Each chapter offers teachers of English to speakers of other languages a thoughtful, expanded view on their profession. Chapters are grouped into three main sections: (1) Resistance to Inner-Circle and Local Standards of English Language Teaching; (2) Changing Attitudes Toward English; and (3) Situated English Language Teaching Pedagogy. Students enrolled in teaching ESOL programs around the world, their educators, and teachers seeking professional development can use this book to learn how their colleagues are responding to the day-to-day challenges of teaching English not only as a global language but also as one that is appropriated to local issues and communication needs.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This study examines the policy and practice of instructional supervision in primary education against a background of an educational change in Kenya. Primary education is an important sector of education in Kenya. This is because about 40% of children who start primary education each year terminate their education at that level. It is therefore important to ensure its objectives are achieved. Consequently the government frequently undertakes reforms aimed at improving access, participation, retention and completion rates. The latest ones are provision of free primary education and a revised curriculum. Despite these reforms this sector of education continues to experience problems in achievement of its goals. Instructional supervision has been identified as key in the improvement of teaching/learning and consequently achievement of educational objectives. The pre and post-independent education commissions in Kenya and other government reports have continued to identify supervision as an area that needs attention. Against this background, understanding what ought to be and what actually happens is important in order to identify areas that need attention for improvement of supervision and subsequently teaching and learning in primary schools in Kenya. This study therefore focused on: - the existing policies on supervision, and the policy expectations of the supervisors- the actual instructional supervisory functions supervisors perform - head teachers' and teachers' expectations of supervisors -supervisors', head teachers' and teachers' perceptions of the importance and frequency of performance of instructional supervisory functions, -and the challenges faced by supervisors and teachers in implementation of curriculum change. The study employed a survey design with a mixed method approach. Data were collected using questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, focus group interviews and document analysis. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to determine if there were significant statistical differences in the respondents' perception of importance and frequency of supervisory functions while Post Hoc test (Tamhane coefficient test which is suitable for unequal sized groups) was used to establish where the differences among the groups were. Both tests were carried out at 0.05 level of significance. Findings show that despite the legal backing and many policy documents supporting instructional supervision, the actual practice differs from the policy expectations. Supervisors were aware that according to policy they were expected to perform evaluative and supportive/advisory functions, however their actual performance emphasises the evaluative/assessment functions of supervision. The head teachers’ and teachers' expectations on the other hand are in line with the policy expectations. For instance frequent supervisory visits, regular in-service training, opportunity for professional growth, induction on curriculum and other changes and evaluation without intimidation are some of the head teachers' and teachers' expectations. However, in their view, they differ with the actual practice of the supervisors with most of their expectations not being adequately met. On average all the respondents perceived the supervisory functions as important but supervisors rated evaluative functions as very important while head teachers and teachers rated the supportive/advisory functions as very important. On frequency of performance of supervisory functions, supervisors perceived almost all functions as frequently performed but head teachers and teachers perceived many functions as rarely performed. These findings have implications for policy and practice of instructional supervision in Kenya and other developing countries in similar contexts. There is need for revision of instructional supervisory policy with a view to separating the evaluative and the advisory functions with the evaluative functions being carried out by the Directorate of Quality Assurance and Standards (DQAS) and Kenya Institute of Education (KIE) to handle the supportive/advisory functions. In addition, training of supervisors for their role should be addressed.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Games in the Ghanaian curriculum are innovations requiring a change in pedagogical practice. In this study, I investigate primary school teachers' experiences and perspectives with the use of common and cultural games in the mathematics classroom. I use craft knowledge, which intertwines knowledge and practice, as an interpretive framework to investigate and analyze the data collected.   Through a survey of 156 teachers, I collected information on teachers' experiences with games at home, in school, and in practice, and on teachers' perspectives of the advantages and disadvantages of using games. Based on the survey, ten teachers (seven users and three non-users) were selected for in-depth conversational interviews (IDCIs) to further explore their experiences and perspectives of using games in the mathematics classroom.   Quantitative analysis of the survey indicates that teachers viewed games in the community as opportunities for social interactions, motivation, cognitive development, moral development, acquisition of cultural knowledge, and physical development. Teachers' perspectives of the advantages and disadvantages of using cultural games were classified into four similar categories. The study showed that although teachers view games as advantageous for learning mathematics, less than 7% of teachers' experienced game use at pre-service and in-service opportunities. Although approximately half of the teachers used games to teach mathematics, less than 23% participants used cultural games. The qualitative analysis indicates that teachers are aware of games in mathematics education curriculum and have rich experiences in their communities, but they had conflicting views as to what constitutes a game, limited knowledge of the mathematics in cultural games, minimal professional development related to game use, and no resources to draw from.   Cultural games in the mathematics classroom have the potential to promote indigenous mathematics, aid curriculum relevance, and help children cross the divide separating school mathematics and cultural knowledge. However, several obstacles were identified that currently stand in the way. The obstacles, possibilities and implications of the study were discussed in the final chapter through three primary sources of craft knowledge including experiences, current teaching situation, and vision of games as instructional tools.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This thesis explored the uses of continuous assessment and the experiences of lower attaining pupils in primary and junior secondary schools at Agona and Affutu Districts in Ghana. The study adopted a range of data collection methods including: self-completed questionnaires, semi-structured and focus groups interviews. A systematic sample of 107 primary and junior secondary teachers answered questionnaires and 12 teachers from the cohort were interviewed. Additionally, four focus groups of Primary 6 lower attaining pupils were interviewed. The main findings of the study were: • The majority of the teachers in the study felt strongly that continuous assessment enabled teachers to support lower attaining pupils to improve. • The teachers reported in the interviews that they used the same approach to assess all pupils including lower attainers in classrooms; this caused the pupils to perform poorly and eventually repeat classes. • The teachers identified policy, larger classes and lack of training as barriers to supporting lower attainers to improve. • Lower attaining pupils in the study reportedly became anxious, frustrated, and helpless before and during class tests, and upset when they failed. • They identified difficult tasks, lack of self-regulated learning and supportive environments as barriers to participating in class tests. The findings have implications for policy, practice, research, teacher training and professional development.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: In 1984 the Ministry of Education in Ghana introduced a career ladder policy for teachers. While reformers believe that this has improved the condition of the teaching profession, the net gains of the policy remain deceptive. There has even been a reduction in some of the benefits that teachers used to enjoy in the single salary scheme in the past. After critically assessing the major aspects of the policy, along with the voices of Ghanaian teachers, this study argues that the career ladder policy for teachers in Ghana is another prototypical case of a failed experiment in terms of both improving the lives of teachers and maintaining their professional rights.    // ABSTRACT IN FRENCH: En 1984, le Ministère de l'Éducation au Ghana a présenté une politique d'échelle de carrière pour les professeurs. Tandis que les réformateurs estiment que ceci a amélioré la condition de la profession enseignante, les bénéfices nets de la politique demeurent trompeurs. Il y a même eu une réduction de certains des avantages que les professeurs avaient l'habitude d'apprécier par le passé avec le schéma du salaire unique. Après une évaluation critique des aspects principaux de la politique, par la voix de professeurs ghanéens, cette étude soutient que la politique d'échelle de carrière pour les professeurs au Ghana est un autre cas prototypique d'une expérience ayant échoué en termes d'amélioration de la vie des professeurs et de maintien de leurs droits professionnels.    // ABSTRACT IN GERMAN: 1984 führte das Bildungsministerium in Ghana ein Karriereleiter-Programm für Lehrer ein. Während dies nach Einschätzung der Reformer zu einer Verbesserung der Berufsbedingungen für Lehrer geführt hat, erweist sich indes dieser Gewinn als irreführend. Teilweise führen die Veränderungen im Vergleich zu der früheren einheitlichen Gehaltsstruktur sogar zu einer Vorteilsminderung der Lehrer. Der Beitrag vertritt die These, dass bei kritischer Überprüfung der Hauptaspekte des Programms, und unter Einbeziehung der Stimme der Lehrer, das Karriereleiter-Programm für Lehrer in Ghana ein weiteres Beispiel für fehlgeschlagene Experimente darstellt, und zwar sowohl hinsichtlich der Verbesserung der Lebensbedingungen der Lehrer als auch hinsichtlich der Wahrung ihrer beruflichen Rechte.    // ABSTRACT IN SPANISH: En 1984, El Ministerio de Educación de Ghana ha respondido a la caída de status de la profesión docente, con sus efectos adversos sobre el sistema educativo del país, introduciendo una política de escalafones para docentes. Mientras que los reformadores creen que la política ha mejorado la situación de la profesión docente, los resultados concretos de la reforma siguen siendo decepcionantes e incluso, en parte, se han reducido algunos de los beneficios que los docentes recibían en el pasado con el sistema de salario único. Entre otras cosas, las afirmaciones de quienes abogan por esta política se centran en una escala de salarios mejorada para los docentes. Sin embargo, hay que reconocer que el aumento de los salarios que se produjo con la introducción de esta política se ha ido perdiendo gradualmente a lo largo de las barreras burocráticas y estructuras de control que se fueron erigiendo para supervisar la aptitud de los docentes en cada escalafón. Tras una evaluación crítica de los aspectos más importantes de la política, aunada a las voces de docentes ghaneses, el autor sostiene que la política de escalafones en Ghana es un caso más de experimento fallido, tanto en cuanto a la mejora de la calidad de vida de los docentes como en el mantenimiento de sus derechos profesionales.

    "Abstract (AB)": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine issues of quality and quality assurance in Kenyan schools, identify reasons why Kenya government has difficulties in achieving its well documented search for quality education and to trace the process for ensuring the accountability of teachers in Kenya. This focus is done under conditions of significant changes in government policies and educational restructuring. Design/methodology/approach: The reflections are done through a review of variety of research and analytical sources. Findings: The review shows that the government, whose approach has been ambivalent and paradoxical, has determined teacher accountability and that the underlying cause of poor quality education in Kenya's schools is not the performance of teachers per se but deeply rooted management practices and other government policies which will have to change if this dream is to be realized. The evaluation of teachers' work should not be separated from development since quality is dependent on professional development. There is no development without challenge and quality development depends on the participation of all persons involved in teaching and learning. Practical implications: The most obvious practical implication of this paper is that education in Kenya needs complete overhaul and not piecemeal reforms. Above all, there is need to invest regularly in the development of teachers, as teachers need access to continuous and effective updating and updating systems. Originality/value: This paper provides an opportunity for reflection and builds a foundation on some of the key challenges that face education and teachers in Kenya. The paper suggests directions for leading Kenyan schools into a successful future.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Leadership is a key commodity in twenty-first century organizations. This is especially true for school organizations. This paper aims to respond to six questions about head teachers and leadership of basic schools. Head teachers responded to survey items about proficiencies required for effective leadership and those demonstrated in practice. The Greater Accra region of Ghana was the setting and head teachers constituted the sample. A survey with a unique identifier was distributed to head teachers at their schools. Analysis was conducted using SPSS and output was translated into frequencies and percentages. A premise of the research was that heads of basic schools lacked leadership proficiencies because of the absence of school leadership preparation programs. Heads of basic schools lack professional preparation in leadership, and practice management and administrative behaviors rather than leadership. Ghana has implemented several reforms with the intent of developing a quality education system; however, there has not been a focus on leadership. The literature is clear about the vital role head teachers have in effective schools and student achievement. This research calls attention to the leadership needs of head teachers in the Ghana education system. This research reveals that Ghana faces a leadership challenge related to head teachers' professional development. The results are an alert to policy makers to institute educational reform that addresses head teachers' leadership in basic schools. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This study examines possibilities for improving student achievement in the Faith Works Schools in Zambia, Africa. Faith Works is a system of community schools providing basic education to students in grade one to grade seven in three of the poorest communities in Lusaka. The study is comprised of two parts, a conceptual piece and a sample training manual. The conceptual part is divided into three sections: An examination of the problem of practice in context including a review of Zambian history, politics and the educational system, a review of the literature around professional development and comparative education, and a summary of how the project was put together. Hence, the training manual is founded on this knowledge base. The manual will serve as an addendum to the Zambian SPRINT manual. For purposes of this capstone a draft version of the manual is included providing background knowledge and directions for implementing three sample sessions of Teacher Group Meeting. These sessions provide an example of ways the Teacher Group Meetings can provide significant ways to inform, hone, and practice the Faith Works teachers' craft with one another. It is hoped that this manual can have practical application for all schools in Zambia.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The need to provide quality and affordable housing to Ghanaian professionals, including teachers, doctors, nurses, university professors have led the government to explore different alternative investment options in the housing sector. Given the government's embrace of World Bank-supported neo-liberal economic policies, it is not surprising that it opted to shift from government-support and provision approach to a private sector-led housing policy. One visible result of this policy shift is the emergence of private real estate companies in many major cities. This study discusses the effectiveness of past housing policies and the increasing role of the private sector in the housing industry. Using questionnaire survey with real estate companies in Accra, the study examines the problems facing the industry and whether membership of Ghana Real Estate Developers Association has any effect on companies' ability to provide housing for professionals. The study calls for more government regulation in this emerging industry. Copies of dissertations may be obtained by addressing your request to ProQuest, 789 E. Eisenhower Parkway, P.O.

    "Abstract (AB)": "This was a qualitative study underpinned by interpretive philosophical thought.&#xa0; It employed a case study approach and collected data in two phases using semi-structured questionnaire and semi-structured interview.&#xa0; In the first phase, a questionnaire was distributed to all headteachers and Circuit Supervisors (school inspectors) in the municipality; the second phase involved semi-structured interviews with a purposive maximum variation sample of headteachers and Circuit Supervisors who had already responded to the questionnaire.\\n  The study highlighted that the headteachers faced multiple challenges.&#xa0; These included teachers’ lack of commitment and uncooperative attitude; non-involvement of the headteachers in making decisions that affected their professional practice; the complexity and multiplicity of their roles and responsibilities; and insignificant responsibility allowances.\\n  The study also identified ways of preparing aspiring headteachers for meeting the demands in the educational context.&#xa0; Specifically, it identified the skills and competencies they required and the training opportunities for the provision of those competences as well as strategies for meaningful selection/appointment of headteachers and their induction.\\n  Findings suggested the in-service training /continuing professional development programmes organised in Sunyani municipality for practising headteachers were inappropriate for enhancing their professional growth and development.&#xa0; The study proposed ways/strategies for improving some aspects of the programmes for meaningful professional development of the headteachers.&#xa0; This research also unveiled additional in-service training/continuing professional development opportunities for the headteachers in that context, including regional-based courses and a cluster-based collaborative headship scheme.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "African nations were preceded by cultures that were hundreds of years old that were absorbed by the nation states that emerged from the colonial period in the 1950's and 1960's. Much of Africa, to varying extents, has adopted the characteristics of nation states found in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Common institutions such as education and government, a national language and currency, social welfare support programs, and a national identity have developed. However, tensions often remain between the nation state and the pre-existing cultures, and those tensions may present considerable challenges for professionals such as social workers, teachers, and police that provide human services. Kenya's history is like that of much of Africa. It has an ancient past of thousands of years, and it is still largely agricultural but with rapid movements of rural populations to urban areas. The Mungiki, initially emerged as a cultural group whose ideals were supported by some members of the Kenyan parliament who complained about the adulteration of Kikuyu culture, and wanted Kikuyu youth to shun Western ways and instead learn the original Kikuyu values (Kikechi, 2007).

    "Abstract (AB)": "The purpose of this study was to analyse the beliefs about inclusion and teaching students with disabilities of physical education teachers from various countries and cultures. The participants were 29 physical education teachers from Ghana (Africa), Japan, the US and Puerto Rico. The research method was explanatory multiple-case study situated in the theory of planned behaviour. The primary data sources were attitude surveys and interviews. Survey data were analysed with descriptive statistics and the interview data were analysed using a constant comparative method. Results indicate that the teachers' beliefs tended to vary on inclusion and teaching students with disabilities. Paradoxically, they expressed compelling intrinsic motives while voicing a multiplicity of concerns on teaching students with disabilities. They all desired greater opportunities for relevant professional development, which should be made available more frequently by school districts. Adapted from the source document.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Mentorship has been identified in the adult and higher education literature as a transformational tool for mainstreaming disadvantaged people by providing direction, networks, and opportunities for empowerment to break barriers (Harlley, 2001). Current global interests in mentorship principles and practices are also supported by evidence of the phenomenon in Ghana, West Africa (Mullins Nelson & Tawiah, 2003).    The purpose of this study was to investigate if mentoring relationships were critical to the advancement of women presidents in colleges of education in Ghana. The theoretical framework underlying the study were the psychosocial and instrumental principles of mentoring (Kram, 1988), transformational learning and critical reflection (Mezirow, 2004), and experiential learning (Kolb, 2000). Four research questions which guided the study were: (1) What role did mentorship play in the lives of participants? (2) What was the nature of participants' mentoring experiences? (3) Was mentoring beneficial for perspective transformation and critical reflection? and (4) How were participants mentoring a new generation of women for leadership?    The study utilized the qualitative method by employing triangulation which specifically focused on case study, phenomenology, hermeneutics, and the narrative analysis approaches. Purposive sampling was utilized in selecting 10 women participants who were interviewed at individual face-to-face sessions. Analyzed data revealed minor problems with mentorship. The overwhelming majority reported immense benefits in the form of guidance towards educational opportunities, academic success, informal professional development, and insights for mentoring a new generation of educators. School teachers and administrators, parents (especially fathers), and inspirational or passive mentors who were never personally accessible to participants were also perceived as mentors.    Results of the study demonstrated that mentoring is cast in complex and multidimensional relationships that transcend boundaries of formal and classical methods in vogue in the corporate world. It stands to reason that while mentoring was beneficial to the women participants, it is a phenomenon that is socially constructed and defies a global definition. Context then becomes a basis for determining effective mentorship.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The purpose of this study was to analyze the beliefs of physical education teachers on teaching students with disabilities in inclusive classes. Participants were 29 physical education teachers from Ghana (Africa), Japan, the United States, and Puerto Rico. The research paradigm was qualitatively descriptive using a multisite interview design (Gay, 1996) situated in the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991). The primary data source was interviewing. Interview data were analyzed with constant comparative method (Merriam, 1998). Results indicate some teachers? self-efficacy was compromised and their pedagogies were troubled with difficulties and complexes beyond those of typical non-inclusive physical education programs. School districts should do more to engage teachers in professional development focused on teaching students with disabilities in physical education.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Background and purpose: The paper reports a study of the perceptions of teachers in secondary schools in the Gucha district of Kenya of their own effectiveness, the structure of their self-perceptions, variations in self-perceived effectiveness and the relationship between self-perceptions of effectiveness and the examination performance of their students. Design and methods: Data were based on questionnaires completed by 109 English and mathematics teachers from a random sample of 30 schools in the Gucha district of Kenya. Pupil examination results were also collected from the schools. Results: Three dimensions of self-perceived effectiveness emerged from a factor analysis. These were: pedagogic process, personal and affective aspects of teaching and effectiveness with regard to pupil performance. Teachers tended to rate themselves relatively highly with regard to the first two, process-oriented, dimensions but less highly on the third, outcome-oriented, dimension. Self-ratings for pupil outcomes correlated with pupil examination performance at school level. Conclusions: The results show that these teachers can have a sense of themselves as competent classroom performers and educational professionals without necessarily having a strong sense of efficacy with regard to pupil outcomes.

    "Abstract (AB)": "This study reports on an investigation into the impact of a national, school-based teacher development programme on learning and teaching in Kenyan primary schools. Building on a national baseline study (n=102), 144 video-recorded lessons, covering the teaching of English, maths and science at Standards 3 and 6, were analysed to investigate whole-class teaching and group-based learning. Interviews were also conducted with school management committees, head teachers, teachers and pupils to elicit their views on the impact of the school-based training programme on learning and teaching. The study found that compared to the earlier baseline, teachers were more interactive with the pupils in their whole-class teaching and greater use was being made of group work. Lesson plans, teaching resources and flexible classroom layouts were also much more in evidence. However, the greatest impact on classroom practice was seen in the classrooms of those teachers who had undergone the most systematic in-service training. The wider implications of the findings for improving the quality of classroom learning in Kenyan primary classrooms are considered. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",

    "Abstract (AB)": "There are various phases (e.g., diagnosis, planning, implementation, stabilization and evaluation) involved in the process of curriculum development. This paper concerns itself majorly with the implementation stage of curriculum development with specific reference to the '2002 Secondary Kiswahili Curriculum in Kenya' (henceforth 2002 SKC). It investigates challenges facing the curriculum implementation of the 2002 SKC since it started to be implemented in 2003. It focuses on teachers, students, learning resources, time allocation among other factors that play a crucial role as far as curriculum implementation is concerned. The paper gives various suggestions and recommendations on how to overcome such problems, difficulties and weaknesses in future revision of SKC. The recommendations are meant to improve the highlighted shortcomings of the 2002 SKC. The paper reveals that Kiswahili teachers were not adequately prepared professionally to implement the 2002 SKC. The teachers encountered numerous problems and difficulties in their attempt to implement the 2002 SKS especially the integrated approach to the teaching of Kiswahili language and literature. The paper offers suggestions and proposes recommendations to the Ministry of Education, Kenya Institute of Education among other stakeholders for future design, implementation and evaluation of Kiswahili curriculum at the secondary level in Kenya.

    "Abstract (AB)": "The purpose of this study was to analyse the beliefs about inclusion and teaching students with disabilities of physical education teachers from various countries and cultures. The participants were 29 physical education teachers from Ghana (Africa), Japan, the US and Puerto Rico. The research method was explanatory multiple-case study situated in the theory of planned behaviour. The primary data sources were attitude surveys and interviews. Survey data were analysed with descriptive statistics and the interview data were analysed using a constant comparative method. Results indicate that the teachers' beliefs tended to vary on inclusion and teaching students with disablities. Paradoxically, they expressed compelling intrinsic motives while voicing a multiplicity of concerns on teaching students with disabilities. They all desired greater opportunities for relevant professional development, which should be made available more frequently by school districts.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The research is a study of the staff development experiences, needs and consequences for secondary school teachers in the Gucha district of Kenya.Â&#xa0; The study set out to establish the situation with regard to teacher professional development needs, the consequences of particular levels of professional development, the perceptions of teachers of their own effectiveness and the main barriers to improving the professional development of teachers..Â&#xa0; It investigates the factors associated with variations in achievement levels across secondary schools; mostly, those associated with teacher qualifications, in a Kenyan perspective.    It involved a sample of 30 schools and 109 teachers; two teachers of mathematics and two teachers of English in the schools, interviews and questionnaires with head teachers and teachers, observation of school educational facilities, collecting examination results and interviewing a senior educational administrator.    The study shows head teachers and teachers both felt the need for CPD for teachers but that this was expressed much more strongly by the heads than by the teachers.Â&#xa0; The areas in which this need was expressed most strongly were in relation to external pressures on schools for new curriculum initiatives and examination performance.Â&#xa0; Constraints on in-service and CPD were related to resource levels and some feeling that it did not bring personal benefits to teachers.    Schools with better qualified teachers and more teachers taking part in CPD had better results although this association was not strong.Â&#xa0; In contrast, there was a very strong relationship between levels of school infrastructure and examination performance with better equipped schools obtaining much better results.",

From the findings it was established that lack of conducive learning environments for adult learners, unavailability of enough instructional materials, negative attitude towards learning and shortage of professionally trained trainers for adult learners were some of the factors hindering many illiterate adults from participating in adult education programmes. It was recommended that the government and other agencies should take more responsibility in supporting adult education to make it more attractive to adult learners to attend the programmes by providing adequate funding and facilitating teacher training. The need for effective involvement of the learners in curriculum developed was emphasized.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Objective. To conduct a summative evaluation of an Early Childhood Care, Education and Development (ECCED) Teacher Training Workshop in Mongu, Zambia by assessing changes in knowledge, attitudes and intent to use the information.    Study design. A matched cohort survey design was used with additional qualitative data collected by structured observation of workshop sessions, daily facilitator and participant debriefs and participant interviews.    Results. Matching pre and post tests were completed by 27 individuals in addition to daily debriefs, structured workshop observation and participant interviews with 22% of the group. The participant population was predominantly female individuals aged 15-44 years old that had completed high school and additional post-secondary training, been teaching children aged 0 – 8 years for 2-5 years in the Western Province and received other HIV/AIDS and ECCED education. Pre-tests indicated a strong understanding of ECCED principles and misconceptions regarding HIV transmission, prevention and the disease's impact on early childhood development. The workshop was found to significantly increase the participants' knowledge of topics covered by the curriculum (paired t-test, N=27, p = 0.004, 95% CI 1.8, 8.6). Participants began with a more limited understanding of HIV/AIDS than ECCED, but the mean gain was much greater at 7.4 +/- 12.3 points. Significantly more participants believed at post-test that HIV/AIDS education should increase for future educators. The 77.8% of participants that increased their knowledge scores at post-test expressed significantly less fear of having a child with HIV/AIDS in the classroom (Independent Samples t-test, N= 27, p = 0.011). Overall participant fear decreased 15.5%. 92.6% and 88.9% of participants planned at post-test to respectively use and share the taught information in their daily professional lives and reported on innovative strategies to communicate with the community.    Conclusions. Teacher training workshops can significantly increase HIV/AIDS awareness and promote positive attitudes in educators working with children affected by HIV/AIDS. Using participant suggested teaching techniques such as poems and songs and translating the materials to the local language could assist future facilitators to both culturally and professionally relate to the workshop audience as well as increase participant capacity to share the information with the local community.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The study used an adaptation of Provus' discrepancy evaluation model to evaluate a distance teacher education program in the University of Cape Coast, the premier teacher education institution in Ghana. The study involved comparing performance data of the program as perceived by students and faculty/administrators to standards prepared from the program's design. Performance data was obtained by administering two survey instruments to a random sample of students and faculty/administrators. Discrepancies between performance and standards were reported. The study concluded that although there were some discrepancies between program standards and performance the program is fulfilling its purpose of upgrading the professional and academic performance of a large number of teachers in the public K-8 schools in Ghana.

The participants were 29 physical education teachers from Ghana (Africa), Japan, the US and Puerto Rico. The research method was explanatory multiple-case study situated in the theory of planned behaviour. The primary data sources were attitude surveys and interviews. Survey data were analysed with descriptive statistics and the interview data were analysed using a constant comparative method. Results indicate that the teachers' beliefs tended to vary on inclusion and teaching students with disablities. Paradoxically, they expressed compelling intrinsic motives while voicing a multiplicity of concerns on teaching students with disabilities. They all desired greater opportunities for relevant professional development, which should be made available more frequently by school districts. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Social psychologists have claimed that social representations influence not only how individuals construct their social and professional identities but how they evolve within their chosen career as well. This research analyses how these representations influence or are influenced by initial teacher training programs and seeks to determine what influence they have on the construction of social and professional identities among student teachers in Kenya. Primarily based on open ended questionnaires and semi structured interviews, this presentation contrasts beginning student representations to those held by final year student teachers. The findings raise serious doubts about the pre service training's ability to precipitate positive outcomes and develop professional identities among student teachers. It appears necessary to deconstruct negative social representations if any positive outcomes are to be achieved. The findings equally highlight the need to take into consideration student representations when (re)formulating training curricula. If our results draw attention to the limits of the training proposed, they also underline the need to change the image of the teacher as is portrayed in society. In this paper, I discuss the social representation of student teachers and the implications of the same on the construction of professional identities. © Common Ground.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "In this article, we explore two possibilities which arise from service-learning engagements, both from a narrative perspective. First, we consider the possibility that service-learning may be a sustaining experience for in-service teachers. And, second, we suggest that intentional inquiry into this experience for in-service teachers may foster the experience of sustaining themselves and of being sustained in their professional and personal lives. Through storying and re-storying our experiences during a service-learning engagement in Kenya over seven years ago and through storying the reverberations of these experiences in the intervening seven-plus years, we suggest that when attended to narratively, the interactions and situations encountered in intentional service-learning engagements through narrative inquiry give in-service teachers ways of sustaining themselves and being sustained as teachers.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Results-based management has gained currency in Kenya. After pre-service training, teachers take various staff development programmes to enhance their role effectiveness. Many studies which have associated staff development with employee productivity have not delved into the actual mechanisms in which staff development impact on teachers' effectiveness. This study was a survey of 100 primary schools which brought on board 100 teachers as research subjects. Using the outlier approach schools in Rift Valley and Nyanza Provinces were bifurcated into high performing and average performing categories. A modified Likert Scale type of questionnaire was administered after validation. The study revealed that the most popular staff development programmes are taking higher education and training, in-service courses and participating in workshops, seminars and conferences among others. During such programmes, teachers learn school management skills, evaluation techniques, academic achievement correlates and master wider content areas of their subjects. Teachers in the high performing schools were found to take more interest in staff development programmes compared to their colleagues in the average performing schools. Key recommendations include granting paid study leave and allocating more funds and time to serving teachers to enable them to participate in staff development programmes. Equally imperative is retraining of teachers aimed at radical attitudinal change towards staff development activities related to their respective teachers.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Teachers are the principal players and actors who make inclusion happen and succeed in any country. Can there be an effective inclusive education practice in Ghana without positive teacher dispositions? Teacher characteristics were examined for their relationship with attitude towards inclusive education in regular schools. With a sample of one hundred and thirty-two (132) professional teachers from 16 Basic schools located in the Cape Coast Metropolis, teacher characteristics such as gender, school location, teaching experience and professional qualification were found to be statistically insignificant with respect to differences in attitude towards inclusive education. Results were supportive of earlier studies on teacher characteristics undertaken in some countries such as UK, US and Haiti. Implications of these findings are discussed and some useful recommendations are provided for teachers, educators and policy makers and implementers in Ghana. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This qualitative case study focused on understanding how teachers and students at a girls-only secondary school in the western Province of Kenya described what they perceived to be caring teacher behavior. Further, the study also examined how students' perceptions of teachers' behaviors influenced their attitude towards education.    In line with the case study inquiry approach, the present study employed multiple data collection methods including in-depth individual face-to-face interviews, focus groups, participant observation, surveys and document analysis. A total of 36 girls and 10 teachers participated in the study. Girls were interviewed within a focus group setting while teachers were interviewed individually. To analyze the data, a voice-centered feminist relational method of analysis known as the Listening Guide was utilized.    The findings of the present study revealed that girls associated caring with teacher academic support, guidance, advice, responsiveness, empathy, understanding, and mothering. Teachers on the other hand, conceptualized caring as academic support, moral guidance, attentive listening, dialogue and humor,  othermothering, friendship, attending to “at-risk” learners, and communally raising young responsible people. An important finding of this study is that both teachers and students projected a gendered view of caring. Male teachers viewed caring solely as a professional stance while female teachers viewed caring as both a professional and maternal stance. Similarly, girls assigned the role of academic support to male teachers and the role of nurturance to female teachers.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This paper explores the experiences of pre- and in-service teachers through intentionally created narrative inquiry (Connelly & Clandinin, 2006) spaces within three different service-learning engagements in Canada, Kenya, and Turkey. Because the contexts where our studies were situated were culturally different from participants' backgrounds, narrative inquiry spaces shaped windows in which participants could restore their understandings of others different from themselves. We argue thinking narratively suits the purpose of learning within service learning, highlighting the potential this kind of work holds for pre- and in-service teachers' professional identities in school contexts shaped by diversity.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "To date, less than ten percent of secondary schools in Kenya offer computer studies as a subject in the curriculum despite its perceived role in the nation's socio-economic development. The few schools that have an Information Communication Technology (ICT) programme limit the number of candidates who take up the subject, considering it a specialty despite its being an essential subject as other compulsory subjects like Mathematics and Languages. The ideal situation would be to have ICT mainstreamed in all school subjects such that it would be integrated in Geography, History, Commerce, Physics, etc. The New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) programme was expected to integrate ICT in all subject areas and to empower the school community with ICT skills. The government decided to use six schools in the NEPAD programme instead of expanding the provision of computers to more secondary schools in the country. It appears that the NEPAD schools project was given preference over all the other ICT programmes in the country then. It was therefore necessary to investigate the reasons for the preferential treatment. As a result this study sought to compare ICT application areas in NEPAD and non-NEPAD schools in Kenya in order to gauge the value of the new programme. The study used a combination of descriptive survey and ex-post-factor design to compare areas of ICT application in the two categories of schools. The findings indicated a significant difference in ICT application areas in NEPAD and non-NEPAD schools. Specifically, learners in NEPAD schools (Mean=6.65+0.360) posted a higher mean grade than their non-NEPAD (Mean=5.70+0.297) counterparts in the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examinations. However, the professional qualification of teachers in NEPAD and Non-NEPAD schools was not significantly different. The results of the study could provide the ministry of education with documentary evidence of the contributions of the NEPAD program to ICT education and the viability of implementing a similar program in all Kenyan secondary schools, especially through the involvement of the private sector players. It could further contribute to the advancement of knowledge about ICT curriculum development in Kenya. (Contains 5 tables and 1 figure.)",

Titled article is on INFORMATION VISUALIZATION AND PROPOSING NEW INTERFACE FOR MOVIE RETRIEVAL SYSTEM (IMDB), written by Ronak ETEMADPOUR, Mona MASOOD and Bahari BELATON from Universiti Sains Malaysia. Their paper focuses on development of a new prototype of visualization in support of movie retrieval. The goal of information visualization is unveiling of large amounts of data or abstract data set using visual presentation. With this knowledge the main goal is to develop a 2D presentation of information on movies from the IMDB (Internet Movie Database) as our movie search engine. The aim is to amplify the perception of users over the retrieval environment while preserving the output quality at an acceptable meaningful level. Visualization ideas deal with visualization of information seeking results. The 9th article is arrived to us from USA and written by James O. BARBRE III on Borderless Educational Practices In The Development Of Commerce, from the Social Studies and Social Foundations Indiana University East, School of Education. This paper addresses online MBA (Master of Business Administration) degrees and the nature of its presence alongside the more traditional face-to-face MBA program.  While the MBA was not originally a global phenomenon, the development of so many online programs has made it one.  Through this analysis, the MBA is first situated historically with subsequent challenges that have encouraged and/or forced it to go undergo changes in its structure over the last several decades.  The approach to this analysis utilizes the lens of neo-realistic principles for organizational effectiveness at the international level.  The article is which numbered as 10, from UAE. Article is entitled as “Students’ First Impression Of Second Life: A case from the United Arab Emirates, written by Salam ABDALLAH, MIS Department of Abu Dhabi University.

G. Faculty of Education, Department of Physics Education, Diyarbakır. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a Computer-Assisted Instruction designed according to 7E model of constructivist learning (CAI7E) related to ‘‘electrostatic’’ topic on physics student teachers’ cognitive development, misconceptions, self-efficacy perceptions and attitudes. The study was conducted in 2006–2007 academic year and was carried out in three different classes taught by the same teacher, in which there were 79 2nd, 3rd and 4th grade university students, in central city of Diyarbakır in Turkey. An experimental research design including the electrostatic achievement test (EAT), the electrostatic concept test (ECT), physics attitude scale (PAS) and self-efficacy perception scale (SEPS) was applied at the beginning and at the end of the research as pre-test and post-test. After the treatment, general achievement in EAT increased (P<0.05), but not all of subgroup. Difference between pre-test and post-test both knowledge and application levels of cognitive domain was found significant (P<0.05), but not in comprehension level. This result showed that using CAI7E in teaching electrostatic topic was very effective for physics student teachers already learned this topic in several physics course to reach knowledge and application levels of cognitive domain.

It's no wonder that many teachers are staunch supporters of their union's struggle to secure resources for education. At the closing ceremonies of each workshop, everyone would stand, hands clasped together, and sing a resounding and moving rendition of Solidarity Forever. We were won over by our Ghanaian colleagues; tney needn't wait four more years to be considered champions!",

    "Abstract (AB)": "In 1998, as part of what was then Zambia's Department of Technical Education and Vocational Training's (DTEVT) human resources capacity building initiative, under the Ministry of Science, Technology and Vocational Training (MSTVT), donor funding was secured to provide degree-level training for key teachers and managers within the technical education and vocational education and training (TEVET) system. However, the lack of degree-level courses designed for TEVET personnel at both of Zambia's universities prevented progress. This situation has disadvantaged TEVET staff and for years has limited their professional development. To address this, a pilot project involving a British Higher Education Institution delivering a degree programme, in-country and in-service (part-time), was proposed by senior DTEVT staff. Some seven years after the commencement of this programme and with three cohorts having successfully been completed, this paper examines some of the key issues in delivery of the programme over the years and reflects on significant events that have influenced the programme's development and are likely to continue to impact on its future direction. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Retaining motivated teachers is a major concern across countries. Ghana, like other Sub- Sahara African countries, has been trying to address challenges, such as the lack of teachers, particularly in rural areas, and the low levels of motivation among them. On the other hand, teachers in developing countries are not necessarily trained and, even if they are, they may not be competent, effective and efficient (Lockheed and Verspoor 1991). Mere enthusiasm and good intentions may not be enough to improve the quality of education. Nevertheless, motivation is necessary, since without it, teachers – especially those facing difficult circumstances – cannot persevere; and, no matter how skilled, without drive, teachers are unable to perform in the long term. As a consequence, without well-motivated teachers, children are less likely to attain the desired level of education. Moreover, if parents/guardians do not believe that education equips their children with the necessary skills and knowledge for a better life, access to and completion of basic education will not increase and government efforts to achieve EFA and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) may be in vain. Teacher motivation is not a new area of research. Extensive quantitative and qualitative research has been carried out, especially in the UK and the US, but not in Sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, in the case of Ghana, most of the research is based on surveys and oneshot interviews and tends to describe why teachers have low job satisfaction and motivation. As working and living conditions for most teachers are challenging, studies into 'motivation' have tended to be superficial. More specifically, little research has been carried out into investigating why some teachers are able to stay motivated in conditions that others do not consider to be conducive to effective practice − or how they are able to manage. In addition, what research has been done has been concentrated in the southern part of the country, which is considered to be better off compared to the northern part according to many gauges. This study has aimed to investigate how basic school teachers‟ perception of teaching as a career is shaped by social and professional environment in rural Ghana. It has also intended to explore local realities with respect to the policy and its implementation for basic education. One-year field research from 2007 to 2008 was conducted by using a mixedmethods approach in two 'deprived'1 districts − one from the north and the other from the south − which are geographically, socio-culturally, and economically different. The methods of data collection involved survey, ethnographic research, interviews, and teacher focus group discussions. This research echoes previous research findings that physical disadvantages − such as the lack of conducive infrastructure, the shortage of teaching and learning materials, and poor salaries − are factors that contribute to a lower commitment to the profession. However, this research also suggests that two other key stakeholders at micro-level − in addition to the teachers themselves − play a role in teacher motivation. These are: colleague teachers, including head teachers; and the communities in which teachers live and work. Support at this level – both material such as the provision of accommodation and food and nonmaterial like morale support – can not only enhance teachers‟ well-being and self-esteem but also help them to see their current positions as a part of their goals. On the other hand, at macro-level, local authorities − the main implementers of policies and strategies formulated at central level and of teacher management − are particularly influential, as it affects teachers‟ long-term vision. They tend to discourage teachers in their operation, mainly due to its organisational culture that teachers perceive neither fair nor rational. With the same reason, strategies put in place to motivate teachers do not always produce the expected outcomes. Moreover, teachers are more likely to be subordinates to the authority even in school management and to feel powerless in the system. Too much emphasis on teacher motivation at school level may overlook the important role of the District Education Offices (DEOs), since teachers‟ lives are much more related to how the DEO manages them than is the case with similar hierarchical relationships in the West.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The purpose of this qualitative study is to make the case for organizing teaching and learning in early childhood around the concept of inclusion rather than transmission of pedagogy through fear and domination. The study explored final-year early childhood pre-service teachers' curriculum planning and evaluation processes, professional education experiences and pedagogical practices, including teacher-child relationships in three kindergartens in Cape Coast, Ghana. A blend of critical postcolonial discursive and framework analysis of data produced three themes: 'curriculum visibility and invisibility', 'children as colonized bodies' and 'pre-service teachers as voiceless identities'. The article concludes that by clarifying and establishing a realistic postcolonial identity for teacher education, positive concepts of teaching and a new image of teachers and outcomes can emerge.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "We want our classrooms to be just and caring, full of various conceptions of the good. We want them to be articulate, with the dialogue involving as many persons as possible, opening to one another, opening to the world\" (Greene 1993 as cited in Nieto & Bode, 2008). These words sum up inclusive education as a multifaceted practice that deals with value and belief systems, invites and celebrates diversity and difference arising from family background, social class, gender, language, socio-economic background, cultural origin or ability with human rights and social justice at its core. In this paper we reflect critically on current pedagogical practices in Ghana in relation to inclusive education. Using a critical post-colonial discursive framework the paper takes up the challenge to problematise the existing pedagogical practices, which are intensely oppressive. It examines the impact of colonial and cultural practices (beliefs, values, norms) on teaching and learning, using data obtained from three focus groups with 21 student teachers, a total of 42 hours of non-participant observation of their classroom teaching and existing research commentaries. We found that current pedagogical practices are prescriptive, mechanistic, and do not value student diversity and different learning styles. We conclude with new directions for teacher education programs in Ghana that value and celebrate diversity, and difference.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The teaching of the Second Vatican Council on the role of the laity in the Church has re-awakened a renewed participation of the laity in the evangelizing mission of the Church. The lay faithful are now occupying a number of significant positions in the Church and are playing various leadership roles once exclusively played by the clergy and members of the religious orders. One of the challenges that most of the lay leaders in Church-related institutions face is that, they are occupying and playing roles in the Church that they were not necessarily trained to occupy or play. This study investigated issues relating to the selection and spiritual formation of the lay principals in Catholic public schools in Brong Ahafo region of Ghana. The study specifically examined how the principal participants were selected and appointed to their present positions in Catholic public schools in the region. The study also examined formal spiritual and educational orientation and professional development resources that prepare these lay school leaders to exercise all the three dimensions of their leadership roles--managerial, educational and spiritual--effectively. The study specifically investigated the challenges the lay principals in Catholic public schools face in exercising the spiritual dimension of their leadership. The study further delved into how the lay principals cultivate, sustain, and promote the Catholic identity and culture of their school communities. Using qualitative methodology of purposeful sampling, the researcher interviewed eight lay principals in Catholic public schools in the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana on how they were selected and appointed to their present positions, and how they learned about the vision, mission, and philosophy of Catholic education. In addition to these eight principals, the researcher also interviewed two key informants who hold vital information pertaining to the selection and spiritual formation of Catholic public school lay principals. The study revealed conflicting reports on how these principals were selected and appointed to head Catholic public schools in the region. While some of the principals claimed they were appointed by the Regional Manager of Catholic schools, others said that they were appointed by the District Director of Education. Investigating further to resolve these conflicting reports, the study discovered that the Regional Manager of Catholic schools in the region does not have ultimate decision-making power to appoint principals for Catholic public schools. The Regional Manager only recommends possible candidates to the District Director of Education who then makes substantive appointment. The study further discovered that the three Catholic Dioceses in the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana do not provide adequate spiritual orientation nor professional development programs for the lay principals in Catholic public schools in the region. The newly appointed principals to Catholic public schools are left on their own struggle to learn about the visions, mission and philosophy of Catholic education. While several of the principals rely on their local pastors to be initiated into mission and goals of Catholic education, others depend on their colleagues to learn about the rudimentary elements of Catholic education and how to run a Catholic public school. Due to the inadequacy of formal spiritual and educational orientation and professional development resources to initiate the newly appointed principals into Catholic literacy, and its philosophy of education, most of the principals find it difficult in articulating the mission and goals of Catholic education to their staff, their students, and the Parent-Teacher Association. Notwithstanding the aforementioned inadequacy in spiritual and professional development programs, the principals had embarked on systematic programs which aim at cultivating, sustaining and promoting the Catholic identity and culture of their schools. The researcher concludes the study by making recommendations pertaining to the issues raised in the study to help enhance educational practice in the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana. He further offers recommendations for future research on Catholic schools in Ghana. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

    "Abstract (AB)": "School mapping consists of the building of geospatial databases of educational, demographic and socioeconomic data for educational institutions in order to support educational planning and decision making. Such databases contain data such as the geographic location of schools, the numbers of existing schools of different levels in the public and private sectors, their capacities, physical condition and facilities, enrolment and the number of teachers and their attributes. Also often included are data on related natural features and infrastructure such as rivers, roads, economic and administrative centers, medical facilities, religious facilities, etc. This paper describes the Kenyan School Mapping Project, whose objective was to collect such data for all Kenyan learning institutions and to integrate them in a GIS database that could be queried to provide useful information for educational planners, other professional users and average citizens. Results show that at the time of the project, there were nearly 73000 learning institutions in Kenya, ranging from early childhood schools to universities; useful information products on important educational indicators such as schools distribution, enrolments, pupil-teacher ratios and gender parity indices have also been generated from GIS analysis of the data. These results have demonstrated the utility of the database for its stated purpose and therefore shown the project to be a useful model that can be emulated by other developing countries. © 2011 Survey Review Ltd.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The purpose of this research was to compare sixth grade mathematics education practices in Ghana to those in the United States. The themes used as a basis of comparison for the investigation were as follows: (1) a brief history of education in Ghana prior to Ghana‘s independence (1957) and the emergence of new practices in schools from 1957 to 2010 (post independence); (2) formal language used in Ghanaian education; (3) the written curriculum, textbooks, and academic resources (including access to library, computer, and internet resources) used in the schools; (4) the current research concerning education trends in Ghana; (5) the professional preparation and certifications that teachers receive in mathematics before the teaching mathematics; (6) teachers‘ methods of instructions; (7) professional development training in the teaching of mathematics for practicing teachers; and (8) teacher perceptions on mathematics and the teaching of mathematics in Ghana middle schools. The data collected and analyzed for the study is from a combination of sources including curriculum document analysis, current available scientific literature in mathematics education, teacher surveys and interviews, and government sponsored reports in education.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The purpose of this qualitative study is to make the case for organizing teaching and learning in early childhood around the concept of inclusion rather than transmission of pedagogy through fear and domination. The study explored final-year early childhood pre-service teachers' curriculum planning and evaluation processes, professional education experiences and pedagogical practices, including teacher-child relationships in three kindergartens in Cape Coast, Ghana. A blend of critical postcolonial discursive and framework analysis of data produced three themes: \"curriculum visibility and invisibility\", \"children as colonized bodies\" and \"pre-service teachers as voiceless identities\". The article concludes that by clarifying and establishing a realistic postcolonial identity for teacher education, positive concepts of teaching and a new image of teachers and outcomes can emerge.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "With advances in using the teachers’ classroom as the foreground for teacher improvement, reflective and collaborative activities have been increasingly used in a variety of professional development contexts. It is widely held that reflective and collaborative activities are conducive to helping teachers to develop a positive attitude towards questioning their teaching for themselves and others as well as empowering them to have control over their professional development. It is in this view that I developed an intervention process to explore what happened, when teachers within one school were given an opportunity to engage in a planned series of critical dialogues relating to their own classroom teaching. The study also explored how the teachers use the Intervention Process to develop their thinking about their practices. Using a case study approach, the IP that ‘sit’ in experimental research, action research which was more qualitative in nature was conducted in one school from, February 2007 to July 2007. Four mathematics teachers purposely and through theoretical sampling techniques were selected in a school considered to be a fair representative of basic schools in Ghana. The field research included interviews and reflective dialogue. Findings from the case study were presented and analyzed for their significance. Key issues identified by the thesis include: the IP creating a conducive environment for reflective and collaborative practices, teachers developing rich and deep reflective dialogue, which provided them with opportunities to systematically and rigorously diagnosing their practices and socio-cultural influence in developing deeper discussions. In addition, the IP provided the participants’ with detailed ways of reflection. Based on the evidence from the data, I have argued, among others, that the IP promoted individualised and collaborative learning. The prevailing socio-cultural elements in the immediate environment supported a rich and deep professional dialogue as a tool for understanding and dealing with on-the-spot professional problems and supporting critical thinking that includes taking account of social, political and cultural issues as a process to analyze competing claims and viewpoints. Recommendations for policy recommendation and potential areas for further research were also made.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The study identified two dimensions of teacher self-efficacy and practices and five dimensions of students' mathematics self-efficacy and sought to determine the extent to which teacher characteristics and practices can enhance secondary school students' self-efficacy. Data were collected from 13,173 students in 193 teachers' classrooms from 141 schools in the 10 districts of Lake Victoria Region of Kenya. Two-level hierarchical linear model revealed that teachers' frequent use of mathematics homework, their level of interest and enjoyment of mathematics, as well as their ability and competence in teaching mathematics were found to play a key role in promoting students' mathematics self-efficacy. Teachers' ability and competence in teaching were also found to be effective in narrowing the gender gap in students' self-confidence and competence in mathematics. The study recommends that teacher training colleges emphasize such teacher practices and values in order to enhance students' mathematics self-efficacy, reduce their level of anxiety and fear of mathematics, and consequently, enhance their achievement in mathematics. Professional development opportunities should also be made available to in-service teachers to continually update their knowledge and skills and develop new strategies for teacher effectiveness.\\n",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The demand for a well-educated workforce has driven many countries to rethink their education systems. An education system has to be suited to the demands of the technological age so that a competitive edge can be maintained. Such demand for a technology savvy workforce is reflected in Alvin Toffler's declaration (Rosenberg, 2001: 3), that \"the illiterate of the 21st century will not be those, who cannot read and write but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.\" An ancient proverb says: \"if we don't change our direction, we'll end up exactly where we are headed\" (Rosenberg 2001: 41). This indicates that learning institutions will have to constantly change and adapt in their environments if they are not to lag behind.\\nEmbracing digital environment in education will enhance efficiency and also provide better learning results as well as make education adaptive to the individual learner. It is fun to learn with computers and skills such as collaboration, critical evaluation, receiving feedback, planning and organisation are easily and effectively learned. It is important to note that learning is dynamic in terms of pedagogy and content. New knowledge is being generated as well as methodologies for delivering it.\\nDue to its potential in interaction between the information, the teacher and the student through various media, ICT has become very popular in the education sector. Kenya has realized the importance of embracing technology in learning and has made tremendous steps towards integrating it in education. The government of Kenya is keen to utilize ICT and other resources to enhance access to learning for all Kenyans as indicated in its strategic plan.\\nOne of the avenues the government of Kenya has used to adopt new technologies in education is through the Curriculum centre. The Kenya Institute of Education (KIE) is the National Centre for curriculum development and educational research established by law. The Institute has adopted the use of computer in curriculum delivery in particular, which promises better and improved methods of content delivery, methodology and pedagogy as well as expanding the available teaching and learning resource base. Whereas technology cannot replace a teacher in the instructional process, it forms an important and additional resource for both the teacher and the learner.\\nIn recognition of the importance of technology, the Institute has set up an e-learning section. This section is responsible for delivering e-content to all its clientele - who are the stakeholders in education and any other sector. Currently the institute has embarked on three approaches to developing and delivery of e-content. These approaches are;\\n1. KIE platform through which the e-learning section has developed content in 11 form one subjects for secondary school level. The section is currently working on the scripting of Form 2 content in 12 subjects.\\n2. Tafakari project which has developed e content for PTE teacher's trainees and teacher educators in science and mathematics on methodologies of teaching. The project delivers its content to its clientele through servers installed in the teacher training colleges.\\n3. KIE elimika LCMS is another approach the institute has adopted in development of econtent. Through this approach the institute has of developed courses which include Primary teacher Orientation and KIE staff induction courses. The developed materials are delivered online and also packaged in DVDs for offline delivery. This system uses Synchronous meetings of online classes which are facilitated by the use of web conferencing/ virtual classroom tools, in this case chatrooms. The synchronous nature appeals to many people and complements other asynchronous activities. This system has seen the Institute make huge savings in travel costs by cutting down on face to face meets. For a geographically widespread class or working group, occasional online meetings have helped keep people on track and provide a valuable opportunity for synchronous discussions.\\nTo further enrich the adoption of technology in Education, KIE has established a Curriculum Innovation Centre (CIC). The Curriculum Innovation Centre focuses on curriculum innovation, use of modern technology and development of personal and professional skills. This establishment is part of the global network of school Technology Innovation Centres and provides access to curriculum developers, teachers and learners in the East African region. The Innovation Centre aims at promoting the innovative use of ICT to enhance modern teaching and learning in the classroom. This, in turn, will contribute to economic growth through development and transfer of technology, new products and world-class skills acquisition as envisaged in the Kenya Vision 2030.\\nTo further enhance technologies in Education, the Kenya government through KIE has continued to develop and transmit radio programs over the years through the National Broadcasting Station. This takes into cognizance of the varied Kenyan populace. Radio programs enhance the access to quality education even to the most marginalized and the pastoralists' communities. Besides the Radio broadcast programmes the Institute has produced TV programmes which cover the mainstream curriculum subjects, Schools and colleges annual educational events such as the Drama and music festivals, National Students science Congress, and other activities scheduled by the mainstream ministry.\\nThe institute recognizes the importance to be in tandem with the rest of the world, thus the need to continually adapt new developments in technology to further enhance education. In this respect therefore, one of the technological areas it has embraces is in adapting the Digital channel. The digital broadcasting is a great opportunity that will meet the unique Educational needs of the society for social, economic and social cultural development. It is further hoped that the Educational Digital TV Channel through which Educational content is broadcast to schools and other learners' country wide is expected to meet the expanded demand for education following the introduction free primary and secondary Education. The channel complements the classroom teacher and other teaching-learning approaches. Besides, the channel also aims at addressing the knowledge gaps to equip the citizens with necessary skills for achievement of Vision 2030 and sustainable development. The unlimited access coverage of the channel promotes the aspect of inclusiveness and broad based participation by reflecting activities that affect the people's well being.\\nThe provision of distance and open learning education through the TV channel ensures uniform knowledge access and better learning environment for learners throughout the country.\\n",

    "Abstract (AB)": "While teachers and administrators in polytechnics in Ghana have categorically expressed the growing need for the former's knowledge and skills to be updated in the era of polytechnic transformation, little attention has been paid to the subject. This study reports a professional development intervention organised for 16 engineering teachers divided among three teacher design teams (TDT) who planned and undertook industrial attachments to update their knowledge and skills in their subject areas. With relevant knowledge acquired, they updated their courses and subsequently conducted teaching tryouts. Data collected during the study through interviews, questionnaires and a logbook sought teachers' learning experiences in TDTs. The results indicated teachers' acquisition of relevant knowledge and skills during the TDT activities. Furthermore, TDT enabled active learning, collaboration as well as dialogue on subject matter among teachers and was a useful means for the professional development process. © 2012 Copyright International Professional Development Association (IPDA).",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The article considers the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) concerned with poverty, education and gender (MDG 1, MDG 2 and MDG 3). Despite considerable achievements associated with the MDG approach, which entails international and national target setting and monitoring, a sharp distinction between areas of social policy is entailed. In addition the approach suggests sufficiency, for example providing a minimum level of education or gender parity, rather than a fuller notion of equality, is good enough. These processes of classification, which entail horizontal and vertical boundaries, are examined, partly drawing on Bernsteinian ideas, and partly through reflections on the concept of intersectionality. Data collected from discussions in Kenya and South Africa with administrators in national and provincial government and teachers implementing the poverty, education and gender MDGs are explored. These show a tendency to work primarily with ideas based on lines, associated with the MDG targets rather than to think more complexly about structure, agency and context in addressing inequality. Thus professionals who confront problems of poverty, gender inequality and inadequate education in day-to-day work lack appropriate resources or processes for gathering information or reflexively engaging with it. The missing resources are partly financial, in that there are not budgets of time or money to attend to making connections. But in addition they are conceptual. Ideas which take a direction to social justice. In the place of a reasoned and reflexive professional language of practice, everyday ideas that connect poverty with gender and schooling are expressed. These tend to reproduce social distance and blame. Putting intersectional ideas to work in ways that consciously and creatively challenge existing sites of exclusionary power appeal key in success or frameworks to the MDGs.

    "Abstract (AB)": "The article considers the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) concerned with poverty, education and gender (MDG 1, MDG 2 and MDG 3). Despite considerable achievements associated with the MDG approach, which entails international and national target setting and monitoring, a sharp distinction between areas of social policy is entailed. In addition the approach suggests sufficiency, for example providing a minimum level of education or gender parity, rather than a fuller notion of equality, is good enough. These processes of classification, which entail horizontal and vertical boundaries, are examined, partly drawing on Bernsteinian ideas, and partly through reflections on the concept of intersectionality. Data collected from discussions in Kenya and South Africa with administrators in national and provincial government and teachers implementing the poverty, education and gender MDGs are explored. These show a tendency to work primarily with ideas based on lines, associated with the MDG targets rather than to think more complexly about structure, agency and context in addressing inequality. Thus professionals who confront problems of poverty, gender inequality and inadequate education in day-to-day work lack appropriate resources or processes for gathering information or reflexively engaging with it. The missing resources are partly financial, in that there are not budgets of time or money to attend to making connections. But in addition they are conceptual. Ideas which take a direction to social justice. In the place of a reasoned and reflexive professional language of practice, everyday ideas that connect poverty with gender and schooling are expressed. These tend to reproduce social distance and blame. Putting intersectional ideas to work in ways that consciously and creatively challenge existing sites of exclusionary power appeal key in success or frameworks to the MDGs.

    "Abstract (AB)": "Since the 1990s, the Government of Zambia has pursued the decentralisation of basic education with strong emphasis on active community participation in local education governance, the aim being to increase the accountability of local education institutions to the community. The accompanying liberalisation of the basic education sector is expected to enhance the role of parents as customers with a freedom of choice in the education market; thus, leading to the greater accountability of schools through the market mechanism. This thesis investigates the extent to which these commitments are being practically realised in rural Zambia, which is a largely under-researched area. Specifically, it explores parental and community participation both in government basic schools and community schools, as well as at the district education authority level through the establishment of the District Education Board (DEB). The thesis undertakes a sociological investigation in order to understand the processes involved in parental and community participation from the viewpoints and experiences of the various local actors. Accordingly, it has employed an interpretive paradigm, utilising interviews, observations and document analysis as sources for the study. The findings of the thesis reveal a considerable gap between policy expectations and the realities at school and district levels, demonstrating that some of the underlying policy assumptions have not been met in practice. The thesis found that parents and communities in the rural setting frequently lack ability, agency and the spirit of voluntarism, factors that conspire to form a barrier to effective participation in local education affairs. These obstacles resulted in part from low cultural and economic capital, and the perception that local education matters constituted the domain of trained professionals. Furthermore, the low quality of education on offer and lack of transparency in the management of school resources also meant that parents judged the cost of participation to exceed the benefits. Thus, the policy assumption of the homogeneous, equal, willing and capable community playing a new participatory role cannot necessarily be taken for granted. Moreover, embedded micro-power relations between education professionals and laypeople, as well as amongst the latter, often influence the way different actors deliberate and negotiate in newly created participatory spaces. As a result, the voices and protests of the socially and economically disadvantaged are often poorly articulated, go unheard and lack influence. Laypeople are expected to play a larger managerial role in community schools, which should increase parental power to hold teachers accountable. In reality however, their ability to realise this was seriously constrained. In a context of chronic poverty, the community was unable to remunerate teachers sufficiently, and subsequently powerless to discipline or dismiss those frequently absent from school, given that it was virtually impossible to find other teachers willing to work for little or no remuneration. In terms of choice, parents were also compromised as customer stakeholders in both government and community schools. Many did not have the socio-economic or geographical wherewithal to exercise freedom of choice, which in any case was not adequately accompanied by either incentives or the threat of sanctions that might encourage teachers to perform better. The thesis further shows that teachers and district officials not only lack the willingness to embrace laypeople in their new governance roles but also lack the capacity and autonomy to respond to the demands of parents and communities even when they would like to; the centre still holds controls over many areas while resources allocated to the local level are grossly inadequate. Therefore, the thesis shows that the extent to which the policy of community participation in local education governance and school choice increases the accountability of local education institutions is open to question. Rather, it suggests that both micro and macro contexts play a vital role in shaping the way in which parents and communities participate in local education governance, in what form, and the consequent influence this has on accountability to the community. Thus, with the use of such a sociological framework, the thesis demonstrates the significance of context, power relations, and the differing social, cultural and economic capital that shape the way different actors participate or do not participate; a consideration that tends to be overlooked in the dominant discourse of decentralisation and community participation on the international education development agenda.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "In the drive to achieve universal primary education as one of the Millennium Development Goals, there is an increasing recognition of the urgency of focusing on teacher education to both meet the demand for more than one million qualified teachers required to achieve this goal within sub-Saharan Africa, as well as to combat the sometimes poor quality educational experience reported in the school. Currently, approximately only one third of teachers are qualified to teach. This dearth in qualified teachers also means that secondary and tertiary education need to be improved upon to provide an educated cohort of graduates. This in turn will ensure that the quality of teacher trained and retained within the profession is of a sufficiently high standard to ensure sustainable progress. This volume focuses on the various aspects of teacher education which need to be addressed in order for the wider Millennium Goals to be achieved, but more importantly, so that each African child living within sub-Saharan Africa will have the right to a quality education: ensuring they too experience their right and entitlement as children to reach their full potential--often taken for granted in Western countries--giving African children the necessary tools to build a better future for themselves. Of particular interest to the education researcher and policy maker, this volume's contributors look at the various issues and challenges around the teacher profession, particularly in relation to resources and practices within sub-Saharan Africa. The contributors examine the issue of building research capacity for educational research within teacher education Colleges and explore the concept of education for sustainable development with the view to improving the development of quality teacher education within the global South. In this volume, research reports are presented highlighting the various challenges within the structure and provision of teacher education within certain national contexts, including assessment and curricula issues, which need to be addressed. This volume goes from the global to the local and examines teacher educator teaching, learning and reflective practice issues within different contexts, as well as exploring alternative pre-service experiences for western teachers who wish to work within the sub-Saharan context as well as some teacher educator exchange programmes between the South and North. Case countries explored include Lesotho, South Africa, Mozambique, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Madagascar, to mention but a few. Of particular value to the education researcher and policy maker, this book provides a timely resource focusing on an area of neglect, highlighting the central role of the teacher and teacher education towards sustainable development within the sub-Saharan African context. This book is divided into three parts. First, International and National Discourses on Teacher Education, contains the following: (1) Education as a Humanitarian Response as Applied to Teachers and Their Training in Sub-Saharan Africa (Colin Brock); (2) Teacher Education in Sub-Saharan Africa: Issues and Challenges around Teacher Resources and Practices (Bob Moon & Freda Wolfenden); (3) Contradictions in Teacher Education and Teacher Professionalism in Sub-Saharan Africa: The Case of South Africa (Clive Harber); (4) What Hope for the Dakar Goals? The Lower Levels of Education in Lesotho and Uganda since 2000 (James Urwick & Rosarii Griffin with Veronica Opendi & Matemoho Khatleli); (5) A Critical Overview of Education for Sustainable Development with Particular Focus upon the Development of Quality Teacher Education in Sub-Saharan Africa (David Stephens); and (6) Building Capacity for Educational Research in Sub-Saharan Africa: Opportunities, Constraints and Lessons in the Context of Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda (Peadar Cremin, Mary Goretti Nakabugo & Eimear Barrett). Second, Case Country Research Reports on Aspects of Teacher Education in Sub-Saharan Africa, contains the following: (7) Towards a Holistic Understanding of Special Educational Needs (Jacqui O'Riordan, James Urwick, Stella Long & Maria Campbell); (8) The Teaching and Learning of Mathematics in Ugandan Secondary Schools: Poised for Change? (Paul Conway, Elizabeth Oldham, James Urwick, Sarah Kisa, Justine Otaala & Anne Mugwera); (10) Implementing the Thematic Curriculum in Uganda: Implications for Teacher Education (Marty Holland, Louise Long & Laura Regan); and (11) How Much Is Enough? Investigating Mathematical Knowledge for Primary Teaching in Lesotho (Dolores Corcoran & Anne Dolan). Third, Teacher Education at the Chalkface: Closer Perspectives, contains the following: (12) Teacher Educators and Teaching, Learning and Reflective Practice among the Turkana Nomads of Kenya (Thomas G. Grenham); (13) An Account of the Alternative Education Experience Africa Programme in Transition: Irish Pre-Service Teachers' Experience in Zambia and the Gambia (Fiona Baily & Deirdre O'Rourke); and (14) Teacher Educator Exchange Partnership in Uganda and Ireland: Closer Perspectives on Teacher Education in Sub-Saharan Africa (Patricia Kieran, Carmel Hinchion, Doris Kaije, Ruth Kyambadde & Paddy Bradley).",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This research adopted a design research approach, utilizing a mixture of methods including narratives, ethnographic observations, qualitative interviews and documentation of design artifacts. It was implemented in a challenging context in Western Kenya. The first research question for this study was: How might professional development (PD), offered through a blended learning approach and delivered by appropriate technologies, inform potential change to teaching practice in a challenging context in Kenya? Research question two sought to understand the implications of the professional development implemented in this study for teachers and professional development teachers (PDTs). Question three sought to understand the sustainability and scalability of the professional development approach.   The theoretical framework informing this research is based on activity theory—a needs-driven and goal directed process through tool mediation, and entails division of labor and isolation of partial tasks in a community of relationships (Vygotsky, 1978; Leont’ev, 1978; Engestrom, 1987; 1999; 2000; 2008). Key features of activity theory are active engagement and social interaction, which enabled teachers to collaboratively work with each other, studying through appropriate technologies to inform their teaching practices.   Based on a review of literature, interviews with teachers and observation of teachers during face-to-face meetings in professional development and in their classroom practice, this study suggests that teachers in a challenging context can inform potential change to their teaching as a result of participation in locally developed content, delivered through blended learning on appropriate technologies. This study observes that through self-directed study on tablets, and occasional face-to-face interaction, teachers can transform into a community of learners that support each other in planning for their lessons. Content development involving local experts is critical to such interventions in challenging contexts, while drawing from global web content, harnessing open educational resources and being sensitive to local culture. Reflective conversations, professional dialogues and technology stewardship were all critical in improving teachers’ practice.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "© 2012 Sense Publishers. All rights reserved. This edited volume, based on papers presented at the World Congress of Comparative Education (Istanbul, 2010), presents research examining pre-service teacher education, in-service teacher development, and the politics of teachers' work in a variety of geographical regions, including Asia, Africa, Eurasia, Europe, Latin America, and North America. More specifically, the chapters examine the situations, activities, and education of teachers in the societal contexts of Cuba, Equatorial Guinea, France, Germany, Ghana, Hong Kong, Ireland, Lithuania, The Netherlands, Scotland, Spain, Turkey, and the United States. The authors address a variety of important questions related to a group of employees who are key actors in determining the quality of education: How can pre-service teacher education best be organized for different purposes in various settings? What kinds of activities should be organized and who should be involved in in-service professional development to promote teacher capacity and commitment to perform their roles in classrooms and communities? What kinds of incentives can motivate teachers' engagement with various aspects of their work? How do certain educational policies and reforms promote the professionalization or the deprofessionalization and proletarianization of teaching? What are the opportunities and constraints for teachers as they seek to operate within themicro-politics of schools and the macro-politics of society? The book thus contributes to refining our understanding of the critical theoretical issues in the field of comparative and international education as well as calling attention to dynamics that should be considered in developing and implementing as well as critiquing and resisting educational policies in varying contexts.",

This study examined the training and development needs of Ghana's polytechnic teachers in an existing curriculum reform scenario as they became involved in curriculum design. Forty-four teachers and four heads of mechanical engineering departments and representatives of the leadership of four polytechnics granted comprehensive interviews and responded to questionnaires. Findings revealed that updating subject knowledge through industrial attachments was a major training and development need for teachers. Teachers indicated that they were keen to get more involved in curriculum design and argued for their subject knowledge to be improved to give them the confidence to do so. The results of the study suggest higher education teachers have training and development needs in relation to effective curriculum design and implementation. It is proposed that polytechnic-industry links are strengthened and that teachers should draw on teamwork to plan and undertake industrial attachments.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Although many studies have shown the need to pay attention to teachers' preparation for the integration of technology in classroom practice, most teachers in Ghana have not had any preparation that develops their technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK). This paper presents a case study of four pre-service mathematics teachers from the University of Cape Coast, Ghana, who worked in two design teams to develop lessons, and subsequently taught in a technology-based environment for the first time. It was evident from the findings that more systematic efforts are needed to engage pre-service teachers in technology-rich design activities, to develop their TPCK adequately. The study also showed the potential of TPCK as a new frame for developing pre-service teachers' experiences in technology integration within initial teacher education, particularly in Sub-Saharan African countries. (Contains 3 figures and 4 tables.)",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This paper is aimed at elucidating the current state of inquiry-based science education (IBSE) in Zambia's high school science curriculum. Therefore, we investigated Zambian teachers' conceptions of inquiry; determined inquiry levels in the national high school science curriculum materials, which include syllabi, textbooks and practical exams; and determined the extent to which inquiry tasks and skills are emphasized in the science curriculum materials. Based on the results, we have proposed ways in which IBSE in Zambia can be improved, particularly in teacher preparation curriculum, assessment and pedagogy. The major results emerging from this study were that teachers' have a narrow conception of inquiry; there is a discrepancy in the coverage of inquiry levels in syllabi, textbooks and practical exams; and there is much emphasis on lower inquiry tasks and skills in textbooks and exams. These findings laid a basis for our proposed plan for improved inquiry-based science education in Zambia, as discussed herein. It is anticipated the proposed plan on IBSE will prove useful to Zambian science teachers, teacher educators, professional development providers and curriculum developers in resituating Zambian's science curriculum to be in line with current IBSE models.

    "Abstract (AB)": "\\n            \\n            \\n              \\nPh.D., Trinity Evangelical Divinity School. the study addresses the church leaders' contribution towards foster- ing peace, justice, and reconciliation in the multi-party political era in Kenya that has been plagued with a vicious circle of ethnic violence. the research carried out in Kenya revealed that church leaders retreated into ethnic cocoons for personal and ethnic interests, where they trampled upon christian identity and loyalty while lifting up the banner of ethnic loyalty, which polarized their func- tionality and responsibility. the per- ceived loss of moral authority and sta- tus on a national platform relegated them to ethnic voices. the ethnic per- ception hampered and hindered their effort in fostering peace, justice, and reconciliation. church leaders recognized and acknowledged their weakness of not living according to the demands of christian identity and loyalty, as wit- nessed in their public repentance to God and to the nation after the 2007 post-election violence that shocked the foundations of Kenya. church leaders have the potential to restore their sta- tus as the conscience of the nation and play an active role in peace building, justice, and reconciliation at both the national and grassroots levels that could help to thwart or minimize the occurrence of ethnic violence. the restoration of church leaders requires a paradigm shift of their ethnic-biased lived reality to a lived reality of christian identity and national identi- ty, so that their prophetic voice can be heard and respected on a national platform by society.  From the relevant literature in the fields of business management, teacher education, recreation, park, and outdoor educa- tion, the fundamental components of competency-based educational pro- grams for leadership development were identified. the leadership com- petency cube model was adapted with three categories (professional, organi- zational, and cultural) at three leader- ship levels (entry, mid, and top), and six core leadership competencies (professionalism, professionalization, organizational learning, learning organization, cultural awareness, and organizational culture change) in two leadership dimensions (individual and institutional).",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Teachers in rural parts of Kenya lack opportunities for professional development (PD). In addition, the teachers have no access to eLearning opportunities like their colleagues in urban parts. Among the factors that do not favor Kenyan rural teachers' access to PD through eLearning include: lack of access to relevant technologies and lack of electricity. This paper shares research findings on provision of teachers' PD through a blended learning approach, utilizing appropriate technologies in a rural school in western Kenya. Ten teachers and two Professional Development Teachers (PDTs) participated in this research. In the study, teachers' needs assessment was done, to inform the instructional design on the topic: How to teach a large class of mixed ability students. The PD was implemented by engaging teachers in a variety of activities including: pairs of teachers collaboratively using a tablet to access self-study content; teachers studying through multimedia content; teachers planning and delivering lessons using activity-based learning and cooperative learning approaches; and PDTs and teachers participating in fortnightly face-to-face meetings. The findings of the study suggest that teaching practices of rural educators can be improved working with local experts to create locally-relevant content for needs-based PD, implemented in a blended learning approach while providing technology stewardship. Teachers accessed and studied through offline content; planned for and implemented cooperative learning and activity-based learning in lessons, using locally available materials; engaged in reflective conversations on successes and challenges; and spontaneously engaged in very lively professional dialogues. While teachers appreciated that it took long to prepare for active learning lessons, it was less strenuous to implement the lessons, because the students took responsibility for their own learning.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Teachers in rural parts of Kenya lack opportunities for professional development (PD). In addition, the teachers have no access to eLearning opportunities like their colleagues in urban parts. Among the factors that do not favor Kenyan rural teachers' access to PD through eLearning include: lack of access to relevant technologies and lack of electricity. This paper shares research findings on provision of teachers' PD through a blended learning approach, utilizing appropriate technologies in a rural school in western Kenya. Ten teachers and two Professional Development Teachers (PDTs) participated in this research. In the study, teachers' needs assessment was done, to inform the instructional design on the topic: How to teach a large class of mixed ability students. The PD was implemented by engaging teachers in a variety of activities including: pairs of teachers collaboratively using a tablet to access self-study content; teachers studying through multimedia content; teachers planning and delivering lessons using activity-based learning and cooperative learning approaches; and PDTs and teachers participating in fortnightly face-to-face meetings. The findings of the study suggest that teaching practices of rural educators can be improved working with local experts to create locally-relevant content for needs-based PD, implemented in a blended learning approach while providing technology stewardship. Teachers accessed and studied through offline content; planned for and implemented cooperative learning and activity-based learning in lessons, using locally available materials; engaged in reflective conversations on successes and challenges; and spontaneously engaged in very lively professional dialogues. While teachers appreciated that it took long to prepare for active learning lessons, it was less strenuous to implement the lessons, because the students took responsibility for their own learning.\\n",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This study examined the validity of Selwyn's computer attitude scale (CAS) and its implication for technology-based performance of randomly sampled (n = 167) multidiscipline teaching faculty in higher education in Ghana. Considered, computer attitude is a critical function of computer attitude and potential performance. Composed of four constructs, and using a five-point Likert rating scale, the CAS measured \"affective,\" \"perceived behavioral control,\" \"behavior,\" and \"perceived usefulness attitudes\" as multi-construct of computer attitude. The reliability of the overall computer attitude and all four constructs scales are positive with high internal consistencies (greater than 0.70) and significant construct validity (p less than 0.001). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant mean differences across all four constructs at p = 0.001. Affective attitude was the highest contributor of computer attitude followed by perceived usefulness, behavior, and perceived behavioral control attitudes. The teaching faculty has relatively high positive computer attitude; with purposeful practice and enabling environment, they can manage technology-oriented proficiencies and professional performances effectively. Further studies in private and public universities worldwide are proposed for practical and academic significance. In addition, relational and invariance of CAS across demographic factors such as gender, age, academic status, and subject discipline are proposed for their differential influence. (Contains 3 tables and 5 figures.)",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This case study uses post-colonial and dependency theoretical lenses to investigate the forces influencing policy, procedures, and participation in international activity in the post-colonial African university environment of Kenya's first national public university-the University of Nairobi (UoN). The research addresses (1) the approaches and strategies adopted by UoN to engage in international activity; (2) the changes that have taken place over time in international activity engagement at UoN since the attainment of political independence by the Republic of Kenya; and (3) the rationales driving participation in international activity. This investigation included library research, document analysis, multiple campus visits, and 20 formal interviews with the faculty and administrators of the University of Nairobi, Kenya. I argue that even though the University of Nairobi now exhibits some degree of agency in her international engagement as an independent post-colonial African University, limitations to this agency are evident given her colonial genesis as a university college linked to the University of London. Despite the fact that greater control has been realized in curricula issues, institutional level governance, income generating projects, and joint research collaboration and international partnerships, the road to independence in international engagement in a post-colonial university environment is still under construction. The University of Nairobi faces many challenges in her efforts to find a place in the global community of higher education. These challenges include, but are not limited to, lack of resources for human capacity building, shortage of faculty and staff, heavy teaching load, bureaucracy, loss of faculty control in setting their research agendas, commercialization of higher education, intellectual property rights violations, and brain drain. Rationales driving internationalization at the University of Nairobi are a consequence of contextual factors, some of which are external to the university and others internal and individual in nature. For example, whereas the academic rationales for participation, including research outlet, professional development, and networking are commonly cited as key motivators for international engagement, equally powerful economic motivators drive participation. I conclude this investigation by questioning the assumption that there can be balanced interdependence between marginalized African institutions of higher education (IHEs) and the developed world, as internationalization proponents suggest, arguing that these institutions are yet to break away from the colonial mold that led to their creation.

    "Abstract (AB)": "The main goal of the research was to explore the lived experiences of Ghana's ICT in Education Policy makers and their impact on ICT education in Ghana. The research used Odorgonno Senior High School (OSHS) as a case study to ascertain how ICT is being implemented. The Assistant headmaster, teachers and students were interviewed to ascertain their ICT use in the school. The study used a phenomenological case study as a research design to explore the lived experiences of the respondents. In all, 30 respondents took part in the study. The findings of the study have shown that as much as Ghana's ICT Policy makers have immensely worked towards the development of the ICT policy document, the implementation of the policy was fraught with operational and leadership challenges. ICT in education implementation process at OSHS was bedeviled with problems such as inadequate ICT facilities, poor Internet connectivity and lack of capacity of teachers to integrate ICT in education. Students were not given enough time to practice their computer competency skills and the inability of the government and school's management to provide ICT facilities to the computer laboratories. Most of the computers were broken down and some were obsolete. It was evident from the findings that computers and the Internet are dominant ICT facilities used in the school. Other Internet facilities were not used. To address the challenges facing the implementation of the Policy, there is need to for a multifaceted approach. There is the need for the provision in ICT facilities to schools, the need for the ICT implementation plan at the national level and technology plans at the school level. Also, there is a need to review the ban on cell phone usage in the schools and professional development training for teachers and school administrators. The Ministry of Education and Ghana Education Service have to put in place persistence monitoring, supervision and evaluation mechanisms in the schools. To alleviate financial pressure on government to provide ICT infrastructural to the schools, there is a call for private-government partnership to provide teaching materials and ICT resources to the schools.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This study explores current CPD opportunities for secondary school teachers in Kenya. It was designed to uncover some of the implicit shortcomings in CPD provision with the aim of creating awareness that would guide policy decisions and improve CPD provision.\\n  The study adopted an ethnographic methodology using a case study approach. Data collected through interviews, focus group discussions, observation and documents were used to answer the following four main questions: What are the current CPD practices for teachers? (2) What are the general views and perceptions of teachers regarding the existing CPD practices? (3) What are the particular issues for the CPD of teachers of English? (4) What are the general views and perceptions of stakeholders (teacher-trainers, inspectorate and school administrators) regarding the provision of CPD for teachers? Participants included teachers of English from two case study schools, head teachers, Quality Assurance and Standards Officers (QASO) as well as personnel from the Kenya Institute of Education.\\n  Findings show that teachers still viewed CPD as in-service training (workshops, short seminars, conferences and courses) despite the existence of alternative models of CPD. While there was evidence of policy support for the promotion of more authentic CPD activities such as school-based quality assurance programmes, such efforts were difficult to sustain due to inadequate induction processes and school level supervisory capacity. On the part of CPD provides, inadequate personal, unequal distribution of resources across departments and lack of a clear separation between quality assurance and administrative issues made it difficult to transform policy into practice. As a result, a tendency to more traditional approaches which ignored the contexts in which learning occurred continued to be endorsed.\\n  In the teaching of the integrated English curriculum, the challenge fell on harmonising the teaching of English language and literature to achieve the national education goals. Inadequate subject-based CPD programmes and lack of teacher involvement in decisions regarding what they considered as their CPD needs stood in the way of their professional development and instructional innovation.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "While teachers and administrators in polytechnics in Ghana have categorically expressed the growing need for the former's knowledge and skills to be updated in the era of polytechnic transformation, little attention has been paid to the subject. This study reports a professional development intervention organised for 16 engineering teachers divided among three teacher design teams (TDT) who planned and undertook industrial attachments to update their knowledge and skills in their subject areas. With relevant knowledge acquired, they updated their courses and subsequently conducted teaching tryouts. Data collected during the study through interviews, questionnaires and a logbook sought teachers' learning experiences in TDTs. The results indicated teachers' acquisition of relevant knowledge and skills during the TDT activities. Furthermore, TDT enabled active learning, collaboration as well as dialogue on subject matter among teachers and was a useful means for the professional development process. (Contains 3 tables.)",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This study explores the use of constructivist pedagogy promoting learner-centered teaching in Kenya's rural primary schools. It explores both the school-based as well as bureaucratic hurdles to the success of constructivist pedagogy. Teacher ideologies, issues of diverse cultures and traditional beliefs, the rural context characterized by underresourced, understaffed and over-crowded schools, as well as teacher professional development are some of the lenses through which the practice of learner-centered teaching is investigated. This qualitative research uses the case-study method, focusing on the instructional practices of rural primary school teachers and data from multiple sites collected through classroom observations, interviews, teachers' journals, a focus group and situated recall, based on video clips of teachers' classroom instruction. Teachers' views on the state and conditions of their work, the official curriculum, adequacy of instructional time, and the value of extant professional development programs are examined against views espoused by Ministry officials. The study suggests that despite the promise of learner-centered teaching, and policy reforms in Kenya promoting constructivist pedagogy, the future of constructivist pedagogies is yet to be secured. It enumerates the threats to learner-centered teaching that left unresolved may lead to an inaccurate conclusion that constructivist teaching is not possible or suitable for schools outside Western traditions. The study suggests a need to re-think current conceptualizations of poverty and its assumed role in educational investment choices among rural communities. It suggests a paradigm shift in how policymakers and education officials engage with rural schools, particularly in communities where schooling has been slow to take off. To secure constructivist pedagogy, the study recommends re-thinking professional development to make it targeted, cyclical, school-based, and more responsive to expressed teacher needs rather than one that is generic, spotty, punitive, and leads to marginalization and isolation of teachers.

    "Abstract (AB)": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore trends and changes in technical vocational education and training (TVET) in emerging economies as a national human resource development (NHRD) approach and its practical applications using Ghana as an example. Design/methodology/approach: A case study approach was used to develop an in-depth analysis of TVET practices in Ghana. The study utilizes a targeted review of literature, analysis of government documents and interviews with key informants as illustrative sources of evidence for developing the case study. Findings: TVET has been identified as a major contributor to skills development in Ghana. Capitalizing on the potential of TVET requires addressing the challenges of increasing employer participation in TVET, improving TVET curriculum to enhance student ' s employability and reflect labor market needs. Additionally, informal TVET plays a major role in skills development therefore it is recognized as part of the TVET planning process. Research limitations/implications: Data for this research were gathered from key informant interviews and archival records. Additional methods such as observations would further enhance this study. Further research of trends in Ghana to validate implications drawn from this research is recommended. Practical implications: This research provides an overview for HRD professionals to understand the potential of TVET as an approach to human capital development within emerging markets. This is because developing comprehensive plans that address national and employer needs regarding talent acquisition, development and retention will re-emerge as a critical objective for TVET system as nations compete in the global market place. Originality/value: This study provides a unique perspective of current TVET practices in Ghana and its implications for human resource development (HRD). Furthermore, it adds to the small but growing literature on HRD in Ghana and in the African context.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This study explores the acceptance of online learning (OL) for continuous professional development among lecturers at Kenya Medical Training College in 2009. The large and multi-campus College faces logistical and cost challenges in ensuring that its 700 lecturing staff have access to continuous professional development. Online learning potentially provides an effective and efficient solution to this problem. A questionnaire was administered to a sample of the lecturers to assess the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of online learning, taking into account lecturers' experiences. Two focus group discussions were also held to assess the lecturers' views on issues relating to OL. We find that there is a high level of acceptability of the idea of undertaking further training using OL as user attitudes towards web-based training were positive. The benefits of OL over face-to-face learning for clinical training and the accreditation of OL courses are issues of ongoing concern to lecturers. Successful and large scale adoption of OL course requires promotion of their benefits in addition to clarification of the accreditation of the available courses. (Contains 3 tables.)",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This article uses a case study approach to explore the viability and impact of learner-centered, emancipatory pedagogies. The research focuses on the implementation of an Oral History Project with students at a Kenyan secondary school. Findings reveal that the project had a significant impact on participants' beliefs about teaching and learning, strengthened students' sense of self-efficacy, and enhanced participants' perceptions of community knowledge. The study suggests that while learner-centered, emancipatory pedagogies are viable and can have a transformative impact on students and teachers, systematic and sustained instructional support and professional development are needed to ensure long-term success. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

Purposive sampling was used to illuminate the richness of individual experience and the philosophical synthesis each participant has undertaken to make strong commitments in their current choices and practices.

    "Abstract (AB)": "Inclusion is designed to bring special education services into the general classrooms. Research indicates that children with disabilities demonstrate better progress when learning with typically developing peers in general classrooms than they would in segregated learning environments. In inclusive classrooms, children with disabilities learn by observing their peers without disabilities. The current study explores early childhood teachers' perceptions of inclusive education in Ghana, and identifies the barriers to inclusion in that country. Purposeful sampling was used to select participants, and qualitative measures were used for data collection and analysis. Results revealed that teachers understood the benefits of inclusive education; however, due to limited resources such as teacher aides, developmentally appropriate materials, and lack of proper training on how to manage inclusive classrooms, inclusive education was a challenge to most teachers. Results also indicated that teachers needed more professional development on teaching in inclusive classrooms and on the knowledge of what constitutes quality inclusion in early childhood education classrooms. Finally, the study revealed the need for more funding in order to recruit teacher aides and purchase more developmentally appropriate materials.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This review deals with the structure and contents of the curriculum; curriculum delivery; the relationship between school structures and the curriculum on offer (\"study pathways\"); and teaching (pedagogy). The review also deals with assessment. The section on assessment discusses the purposes of assessment (whether formative and/or summative), its timing and methods, as well as the roles and responsibilities of those involved. Decisions about approaches to the curriculum and assessment are closely linked to how many teachers there are, their knowledge and skills, the resources available and quality assurance. A number of key questions are tackled in this review: (1) Why are governments interested in the curriculum and assessment? What are the drivers for change? (2) Why and how have successful and improving education systems changed the duration and structure of schooling alongside curriculum reform? (3) What part do teachers' capabilities play in the design and implementation of changes to the curriculum and assessment? and (4) How much autonomy do schools and teachers have in designing their curricula? Driven by the need to compete economically and to give their population wider and more equitable access to education, high-performing and improving education systems are engaged in a continuing process of reform of their curricula and assessment systems. They see more inclusive and longer access to education not just as good in itself, but also as a means of enabling students to make more effective contributions to the economy. The following are appended: (1) Chile; (2) Hong Kong; (3) Ghana; (4) New Zealand; and (5) Hong Kong.

    "Abstract (AB)": "Background Rehabilitation services are scarce in low-income countries, where under-representation of some specialist professions has led to the role extension of others. An example of this can be found in Kilifi in Kenya where the role of speech and language therapy has been taken on by occupational therapists and teachers. Aims To investigate the communication practices used by these professional groups to support children with complex communication needs in a rural part of Kenya and to explore the ways in which this might be seen to facilitate or obstruct improved communication by asking the following questions: What are the critical features of interactional discourse in practitioner-child dyads with caregiver-child dyads providing a natural comparison? What communicative modalities and practice techniques are invoked? And how does this information relate to extending professional roles? Methods & Procedures An in-depth, descriptive study of a case series was conducted in a school for deaf children and the occupational therapy department of a district general hospital. A mixed methodology was used involving naturalistic observation and applied linguistics analysis. A convenience sample was established comprising six practitioner-child dyads assigned to partnership types: (A) three children with hearing impairment and their teachers; and (B) three children with cerebral palsy and their occupational therapists. As a natural comparator, the same three children in B were also observed with their mothers (partnership type C). Dyadic interaction was video recorded on three occasions. The video data were sampled, transcribed into standard orthography and translated. Codes were applied to determine turn structure, linguistic move types and communicative modalities. Sequential analysis was conducted on the move types. Outcomes & Results Partnership type A dyads showed a fairly even turn distribution between teacher and child. A common pattern was teacher-initiated Instruct and Model/Prompt, followed by child response in the form of an Action. The most frequently used modality was Sound Production and Hands-on-Articulators, which corresponded to articulation drill practice. Partnership type B dyads revealed a tendency towards adult domination of turns. The majority of adult-initiated moves required no response from the child. The practice technique Hands-on-Articulators involved manipulating the oral musculature of the child. Partnership type C dyads showed resonances of type B dyads, although focused more on Motor-Action in relation to task performance. Conclusions & Implications The assignment of speech and language therapy duties to teachers and occupational therapists has resulted in suboptimal practice for children with complex communication needs. © 2013 Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This study examined how teachers perceive Free Primary Education had influenced access, retention and progression of marginalized students in primary schools in Kisii County, Kenya. A critical pedagogy framework was used to unpack and shed light on teacher and school practices that affected access to basic education of at risk students. Data was collected through 217 surveys given to teachers from 28 purposefully selected primary schools in Kisii County, 3 administrator interviews, and 4 focus group interviews comprised of a total of 30 classroom teachers from 14 schools in a sequential mixed methods design. Four research questions that guided this research were: a) How do teachers perceive Free Primary Education in Kenya has influenced access to primary education for marginalized students? b) What do teachers perceive to be at risk categories for marginalized students? c) How do teacher practices influence the retention of marginalized students in education in Kenya? Finally, d) to what extent do teacher beliefs influence their desire to differentiate instruction for marginalized students? Findings from this study indicated that Free Primary Education had led to increased access to basic education through reduction of fees paid by parents to schools, provision of instructional materials, open admission policy, and construction and/or renovation of existing educational facilities. The study also revealed roadblocks that hinder access to basic education for marginalized students such as extra fees levied by schools to parents, poverty, high teacher pupil ratio, lack of skills to equitably educate at risk students in classrooms, and poor health. The participants identified orphans, students with low incidence disabilities, children from extremely poor families, children from single parent households, children engaged in child labor, and children from negligent parents as categories of students who were at risk for marginalization. Moreover, the study revealed some of the teacher and schooling practices with regard to handing marginalized students which included teacher care, professional development, accommodations, remedial teaching, and guidance and counseling. There was a significant correlation between teacher philosophies and teacher willingness to differentiate instruction (rs= 0.43, p<0.05), and also a significant correlation between teachers’ philosophies and their willingness to give various accommodations to marginalized students in their classrooms (rs=0.34, p<0.05). Further analysis of data revealed that, a) access to basic education as a class issue, b) access to basic education as a gender issue, c) national tests and measurements as instruments for marginalization, and d) access to education as a teacher critical consciousness issue.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "JiFUNzeni blended learning approach is a sustainable approach to provision of professional development (PD) for those in challenging educational contexts. JiFUNzeni approach emphasizes training regional experts to create blended learning content, working with appropriate technology while building content repositories. JiFUNzeni approach was field tested though a design-based research intervention conducted in rural western Kenya. The field test included design, development and implementation of a blended learning course for teachers' professional development utilizing appropriate technologies including tablets powered by solar energy, open educational resources and open source software. One year after the intervention, there were follow-up interviews conducted with eight of the ten teachers and two PDTs who participated in the research. The findings from the follow-up interviews shared in this paper revealed that: teachers still used cooperative learning and activity-based learning strategies in their teaching. The PDTs on the other hand designed, developed and implemented one other jiFUNzeni blended learning course for twelve teachers in one school in Korogocho in Nairobi city. Implementation by PDTs of jiFUNzeni approach confirmed that they had learned through a sustainable way of delivering professional development in challenging educational contexts. The PDTs utilized the instructional design approaches learned through their participation in the research in designing blended learning content, while they also innovated new ways of developing self-study content as an important creative addition to what they had previously learned. Two teenage children participated in digital content development by advising the PDTs on more efficient ways of applying technology attesting to the fact that digital natives are important reciprocal supporters to digital immigrants and vice versa.\\n",

This paper presents findings from studies on the implementation of the poverty, education and gender MDGs in Kenya and South Africa. These show how top-down processes associated with meeting the MDG targets led by government or large NGOs are disassociated from bottom-up engagements with gender, education and poverty by households or communities. A missing middle linked with professional action by teachers or civil servants and enhanced information flow means that groups from the top and the bottom talk past each other. We therefore argue that these experiences with implementing the MDGs, coupled with a variety of global changes since 2000s, mean that a major concern in developing a set of post 2015 goals is the need to address the disarticulation between 'top down' and 'bottom up' approaches in international development. We link this challenge with five principles put forward for post 2015 goals and indicators: holism, equity, sustainability, ownership and global obligation. The application of this approach to work on goals and targets is illustrated in relation to nutrition/food security and secondary education.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",

This article presents part of an investigation for a Master's dissertation (Parsaloi, 2012). The broad research aim was to investigate the lived experiences of women heading public rural primaiy schools in Kenya, and to explore possible strategies that may be applied to improve women's participation in educational leadership in rural primaiy schools in Kenya. This article is limited to the findings regarding the lived experiences of female head teachers in rural primaiy schools within Kajiado County in Kenya. The data were gathered using qualitative methods, which included interviews with 15 female head teachers, observation at their 15 schools and field-notes. The women gave rich descriptions of the various aspects of their work-lives within the context of sharing the challenges and strengths experienced in their careers. The findings revealed rich descriptions of participants' professional and personal experiences prior to and in their head teacher positions. The study found that the participation of women in primary school leadership positions could be enhanced by means of mentoring and appropriate training programmes for the preparation for leadership.

    "Abstract (AB)": "Purpose: The paper sets out to analyse the quality education curriculum innovations that have been implemented in Kenya since independence in 1963. The purpose of the analysis is to assess the success and or failure of the innovations and determine the lessons learned that can inform future design and implementation of curriculum innovations designed to improve the quality of education. Design/methodology/approach: This was a desk review of curriculum policy documents and related research literature. The documents analysed included various education commission reports produced by education commissions, committees and task forces appointed to inquire into education and make recommendations to government; primary school syllabuses and related research literature. Findings: The review has revealed that the curriculum innovations recommended and implemented in Kenya have targeted the attainment of the goals of individual and national economic development; national identity and unity; socio-cultural, moral and ethical development; cognitive development and globalization; and psycho-social skills development. Many of the innovations have not been implemented effectively. Impediments to effective implementation have included hasty implementation, limited in-service training for teachers, inadequate ongoing professional support for teachers, and inadequate resources. Research limitations/implications: Achieving effective curriculum innovation is not easy. It requires greater participation in curriculum decision making, patience in training those in various levels of the curriculum implementation process and enormous resources. Originality/value: In adopting content analysis as a methodology, the paper constitutes a unique contribution to the study of curriculum innovation in Kenya.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Purpose - The paper sets out to analyse the quality education curriculum innovations that have been implemented in Kenya since independence in 1963. The purpose of the analysis is to assess the success and or failure of the innovations and determine the lessons learned that can inform future design and implementation of curriculum innovations designed to improve the quality of education. Design/methodology/approach - This was a desk review of curriculum policy documents and related research literature. The documents analysed included various education commission reports produced by education commissions, committees and task forces appointed to inquire into education and make recommendations to government; primary school syllabuses and related research literature. Findings - The review has revealed that the curriculum innovations recommended and implemented in Kenya have targeted the attainment of the goals of individual and national economic development; national identity and unity; socio-cultural, moral and ethical development; cognitive development and globalization; and psycho-social skills development. Many of the innovations have not been implemented effectively. Impediments to effective implementation have included hasty implementation, limited in-service training for teachers, inadequate ongoing professional support for teachers, and inadequate resources. Research limitations/implications - Achieving effective curriculum innovation is not easy. It requires greater participation in curriculum decision making, patience in training those in various levels of the curriculum implementation process and enormous resources. Originality/value - In adopting content analysis as a methodology, the paper constitutes a unique contribution to the study of curriculum innovation in Kenya.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The concept of the professional in the context of a rapidly expanding higher education sector in a developing country offers interesting insights into the values, attitudes and motivations of lecturers. The article charts the expansion of higher education and summarises the challenges that it faces. It goes on to examine through interviews with faculty (staff) in one private university in Kenya what they understand by professionalism, what constitutes professional (and less than professional) behaviour and whether they feel that the institution supports or militates against professionalism amongst the academic workforce. The findings suggest that their view is unproblematic and resides in their specialist knowledge and accompanying values and behaviours and is less concerned with status, autonomy or agency. Faculty are clear what a professional is and what constitutes professional behaviour, but appear to recognise and accept that this is a low-status profession where colleagues struggle to survive materially, often prioritise extra teaching for research and enjoy limited opportunities for professional development. The research suggests that Kenya, and other countries in a similar position, may well struggle to provide an environment where professionalism will flourish as staff face a range of challenges to grow and improve their higher education system.

    "Abstract (AB)": "In recent years, instructional supervision has been given a great deal of attention in teacher education professional literature. However, few reported studies have specifically focused on desired qualities of instructional supervisors, especially in Third World countries. This paper reports the perceptions of teachers, headteachers and senior government education officers regarding skills and attributes of internal instructional supervisors in public secondary schools in Kenya. Findings indicated the following major desired skills and attributes of internal instructional supervisors: (a) ability to lead by example; (b) high integrity; (c) knowledge about delegation; (d) knowledge about public relations; (e) supervisory skills; and (f) competence in teaching subjects. In addition, headteachers, as instructional supervisors, should be qualified and experienced teachers. The reported findings are part of a large-scale qualitative and quantitative survey research undertaken in Kenya to determine the perceptions of headteachers, teachers, and senior government education officers regarding the practices of internal instructional supervision and staff development in Kenyan public secondary schools.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This research builds on work carried out in England looking at how faculty negotiate their personal and professional identities. It focuses on a sample of full-time faculty in a private secular university in Kenya. Weekly time logs with follow-up individual semi-structured interviews were used as a basis for an examination on how faculty spend their time and cope with the dilemmas they face. The research probes the motivations and priorities of faculty and draws tentative conclusions regarding their professional identities. The picture emerges of a rapidly increasing workforce, very positive about teaching, facing the challenges of intensification of labour, conflicting priorities, outside pressures and a sense of lack of control over their professional lives. In contrast to the UK findings, what was most striking was the lack of dilemmas and agonising between competing claims on time that characterised the work of the UK lecturers. The Kenyan faculty appeared to approach tasks in a pragmatic way, with priority often given to family matters and a tendency to let things happen. Notions of professionalism appeared to be less well developed and appeared to point to compliance and acceptable standards of behaviour.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to share reflections of the three authors on the process of instructional design and implementation of blended learning for teachers' professional development (PD) in rural western Kenya. It proposes reforms in provision of teachers' professional development to enable professional development providers to access specialized skills in instructional design (ID) and blended learning. Design/methodology/approach - The paper resulted from a design-based research including 12 entry and 12 exit interviews, observations of three face-to-face meetings of blended learning sessions and ten classroom observations of teachers implementing new teaching approaches learned through blended learning. Findings - The paper provides insights into the authors' experiences in this research. They shared the following reflections: engagement in ID empowered them and they are confident that they can engage in systematic instructional design on a larger scale; they gained technical knowledge and skills in authoring content in HTML on eXe open source platform; uploading the content and processing audio and video content was equally enthralling to them. Research limitations/implications - Because of the chosen research approach, the research results may lack generalisability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to consider incorporating the design-based research, instructional design and blended learning approaches used in this study while conducting related research in their dissimilar contexts. Practical implications - The paper includes implications for the design, development and implementation of teachers' professional development for challenging contexts as a contribution towards achievement of both Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Education for All (EFA). Originality/value - This paper fulfils an identified need to study provision of professional development for teachers who lack opportunities for professional development.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Initial teacher education programs are continuously looking for ways to grow and evolve to meet the changing needs of pre-service teachers (PSTs) who will face a diverse student population when they begin their careers. This study examines a short-term, cross-cultural, service-learning immersion undertaken by 21 undergraduate PSTs to an internally displaced people's (IDP) camp in Kenya for three weeks. The PSTs worked in the local school, a home for orphaned children, and in the IDP. The impact of the trip and the subsequent affiliation with the school and the community has had a significant effect in shaping the perceptions of the participating PSTs. This article explores the impact of the service-learning experience from the perspective of the evolving personal growth and professional competencies of the PSTs and the importance of implementing such programs with PSTs to enhance learning and improve perceptions about the importance of education",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The HIV/AIDS pandemic's dramatic impact on African life and culture has influenced educational sector significantly. As a result of the chronic crisis, teacher retention in Zambia has reached abysmal lows. This qualitative narrative inquiry study explored teacher retention in a Zambian school through the lens of social constructivism. The study explored the interplay of three constructs that enabled teachers to remain in the profession despite the chronic crisis. The constructs were: 1) teacher perceived self-efficacy, 2) stress, burnout, and coping mechanisms, and 3) teacher training and educational practice. Teachers with high-perceived self-efficacy believe that goals can be accomplished. Management of teacher stress, burnout, and coping mechanisms enable teachers to overcome obstacles and remain active in the profession. Teacher training and educational practice is related to the rigor and duration of pre-service training, and resultant pedagogical practice. The five Zambian teachers in the study were from an impoverished community that has been massacred by HIV/AIDS. The majority of participants were from the Bemba ethno-linguistic tribal affiliation. Participants were selected through purposeful sampling in accordance with criteria established for the study. I interviewed all participants in a group and individually. Many themes emerged during the interviews and I \"restoried\" each interview after successive coding of emergent themes. The data was evaluated through the theoretical lens of social constructivism and involved the interpretive process. The data illuminated some of the influences that the HIV/AIDS pandemic has had on teacher retention as a result of the interplay between the three constructs. The five Zambian teachers had a high-perceived self-efficacy that could be attributed to their support systems, professional associations, or interactions. Thus teachers with support systems had a high-perceived self-efficacy were more likely to overcome stressful situations. As such, a well-developed system of coping mechanisms indicated teacher resilience. In addition, teachers who complete a rigorous teacher-training program adeptly manage educational practice in the midst of a harsh environment. An evaluation of a 1) teachers' perceived self-efficacy, 2) stress, burnout and coping mechanisms, and 3) teacher training and educational practice are clues for prediction of the likelihood of levels of teacher retention.

    "Abstract (AB)": "This research explores manifestations of \"diploma disease\" in distance education (DE) upgrading programmes for basic school teachers in Ghana. A survey design which included document analysis was used to explore the emphasis in the contents of the DE programme and the experiences of teachers who took the programmes. The study involved a sample of 230 students (140 males and 90 females) who were all teaching in public schools (66% in primary and 31% in junior high schools). The findings indicate that the programme was fulfilling its purpose of upgrading a large number of teachers so they acquired a diploma and/or degree qualification for teaching in Ghanaian basic schools. In spite of their average satisfaction with their experiences of several aspects of the DE upgrading programme, a substantial proportion of the participants indicated that they had great difficulties in carrying out such activities as \"teaching large classes\" and \"teaching new content areas introduced into the syllabuses\" because the programme provided little opportunity to develop these skills. Finally, since the DE programme is based on the official curriculum designed for the traditional face-to-face programme, the failure of the former to increase teachers' capacity to deliver as envisaged by the initiators of the programme can be attributed largely to inefficiencies in the official curriculum. The study concluded that the DE programme's inability to increase teachers' capacity to deliver better teaching is a manifestation of a \"diploma disease\" resulting from inefficiencies in the nation's teacher education system. Suggestions are made for improving the quality of DE upgrading programmes.",

All participants completed a pre and post practicum Global-Mindedness Survey (Hett, 1993), participated in interviews, and engaged in personal and public reflections. Our results suggest that the Kenyan practicum significantly increased the teacher candidates' global-mindedness and intercultural competence. The teacher candidates' teaching practice was positively affected as reflected in their increased commitment to build community, improved skills in teaching English language learners, their ability to globalize the curriculum, and their confidence in the realization that they were their own greatest teaching resource. We theorize planned transformative learning opportunities during the cultural immersion of international practicums can greatly enhance the intercultural competence of teachers in today's diverse classrooms.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This study focuses on Kenyan student-teachers' professional learning and development in health education in a participatory action research project conducted in one Kenyan teacher training college. The aim was to explore the potential of participatory action research to instigate change in student-teachers' health education practices in a pedagogical context often described as authoritarian, teacher dominated and science oriented. Twenty-nine Kenyan second-year student-teachers envisioned and experimented with health education practices in primary schools as part of a participatory action research project, drawing on emancipatory values. Experiences from the participatory action research are discussed, drawing on critical theory to understand emerging themes such as reflexivity, development of multiplicity in health education and empowerment. The paper concludes that participatory action research in Kenyan teacher education potentially offers a site for educational development, in spite of the somewhat disempowering setting of teacher training colleges. © 2014 © 2014 Educational Action Research.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "JiFUNzeni blended learning approach is a sustainable approach to provision of professional development (PD) for those in challenging educational contexts. JiFUNzeni approach emphasizes training regional experts to create blended learning content, working with appropriate technology while building content repositories. JiFUNzeni approach was field-tested though a design-based research intervention conducted in rural western Kenya. The field test included design, development and implementation of a blended learning course for teachers' professional development utilizing appropriate technologies including tablets powered by solar energy, open educational resources and open source software. One year after the intervention, follow-up interviews were conducted with eight of the ten teachers and two professional development tutors (PDTs) who participated in the research. The findings from the follow-up interviews shared in this paper revealed that: teachers still used cooperative learning and activity-based learning strategies in their teaching. The PDTs on the other hand designed, developed and implemented one other jiFUNzeni blended learning course for twelve teachers in one school in Korogocho slum in Nairobi city. Implementation by PDTs of jiFUNzeni approach confirmed that they had learned through a sustainable way of delivering professional development in challenging educational contexts. The PDTs utilized the instructional design approaches learned through their participation in the research in designing blended learning content, while they also innovated new ways of developing self-study content as an important creative addition to what they had previously learned. Two teenage children participated in digital content development by advising the PDTs on some appropriate ways of applying technology thus, attesting to the fact that digital natives are important reciprocal supporters to digital immigrants and vice versa. © ACPIL.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "JiFUNzeni blended learning approach is a sustainable approach to provision of professional development (PD) for those in challenging educational contexts. JiFUNzeni approach emphasizes training regional experts to create blended learning content, working with appropriate technology while building content repositories. JiFUNzeni approach was field-tested though a design-based research intervention conducted in rural western Kenya. The field test included design, development and implementation of a blended learning course for teachers' professional development utilizing appropriate technologies including tablets powered by solar energy, open educational resources and open source software. One year after the intervention, follow-up interviews were conducted with eight of the ten teachers and two professional development tutors (PDTs) who participated in the research. The findings from the follow-up interviews shared in this paper revealed that: teachers still used cooperative learning and activity-based learning strategies in their teaching. The PDTs on the other hand designed, developed and implemented one other jiFUNzeni blended learning course for twelve teachers in one school in Korogocho slum in Nairobi city. Implementation by PDTs of jiFUNzeni approach confirmed that they had learned through a sustainable way of delivering professional development in challenging educational contexts. The PDTs utilized the instructional design approaches learned through their participation in the research in designing blended learning content, while they also innovated new ways of developing self-study content as an important creative addition to what they had previously learned. Two teenage children participated in digital content development by advising the PDTs on some appropriate ways of applying technology thus, attesting to the fact that digital natives are important reciprocal supporters to digital immigrants and vice versa.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "If children do not learn how to read in the first few years of primary school, they will struggle to complete the cycle and are at greater risk of dropping out. It is therefore crucial to identify and test interventions that have the potential of making a large impact, can be implemented quickly, and are affordable to be taken to scale by the Kenyan government. This is the goal of the PRIMR Initiative--to test various options for improving learning outcomes and instruction in Kenyan schools, using a randomized controlled design. The design is essential to this contribution, as many pilot programs in the sector do not test the impacts of quality-improvement methods at a medium scale and with enough rigor to identify a causal impact. In this paper, the authors focus on early-grade literacy outcomes--reading fluency and comprehension--after one year of implementation for pupils in grades 1 and 2. Study findings indicated that the first year of PRIMR had a positive impact on the three outcomes of interest--oral reading fluency, the percentage of pupils who read at the MOE's benchmark, and reading comprehension--although not on all combinations of language, grade, and school type. Also, the meaningful first-year impacts of PRIMR on student achievement have implications for teacher professional development in Kenya. One table and one figure are appended.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This thesis investigates the emerging policy vision and assumptions underlying the promotion of school self-evaluation (SSE) as an innovative strategy for school improvement in Kenya, and the ways in which they are understood and practiced by various stakeholders. My professional involvement in SSE policy development led me to think that too little was known about its practice. Therefore, I specifically explored the acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness of this evaluation process, focusing on social interaction and contextual factors at the school/community level through an exploratory qualitative case study and continuous professional reflection. By critically questioning linear, top-down policy assumptions, I sought multiple stakeholder viewpoints within contextual specificities in order to capture and understand the realities – complex, diverse and organic processes – on the ground. Accordingly, I employed interactionist and constructivist paradigms, and utilised interviews, observations and documentary analysis as sources. The findings suggest that there is a considerable gap between SSE policy expectations and its practice on the ground, while also highlighting some positive experiences and future potential. Stakeholders at all levels largely understand and accept the idea of participatory, inclusive and democratic SSE conceptually, but they have not yet embraced it practically. The education authority's monopoly on the power to evaluate schools is identified as a key systemic bottleneck that effectively restricts meaningful SSE practice on the part of school-level stakeholders who follow instructions from above in a regime of professional legitimacy. Conversely, study findings indicate that both collective and individual SSE approaches promoted in Kenya are feasible, policymakers' paternalistic concerns notwithstanding. Teachers were found to demonstrate their collective ability to apply the prescriptive SSE tool to fit their unique contexts and assess school quality. They also successfully engaged with individual SSE (action research) which, the thesis contends, can initiate a ‘positive spiral of change' through which teachers build their confidence based on small but real successes, transform perspectives and professional attitudes, and ultimately engage in self-reflective practices for school improvement. However, the thesis concludes that the Kenyan policy assumption of evidence-based school development remains largely theoretical, schools tending to engage in ad-hoc improvement through unsophisticated planning in the absence of systematic SSE. Overall, I argue that it is important to acknowledge and utilise the education authority's power and influence (i.e. the leadership of the Ministry of Education, and its Quality Assurance and Standards Directorate) in a positive manner that will lead to a more realistic and pragmatic approach to SSE promotion. Contending that institutionalising a ‘culture of learning' is the way forward, I present a scenario whereby SSE may lead to sustained school improvement with two key strategies: (i) merging individual and collective SSE; and (ii) combining internal and external school evaluation. Moreover, I argue that the education authority's monopoly on school evaluation should also be tackled so that an integrated system for quality improvement can be realised in Kenya. Based on the study findings, the thesis presents a number of policy recommendations including formal utilisation of the SSE tool; substantial stakeholder participation; enhanced teacher training; external quality assurance to validate SSE results; strengthened district-level peer learning and school leadership; and improved policy coordination and dissemination. Finally, I reflect on my professional position with renewed commitment to contribute to the achievement of quality education for all children.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This chapter focuses on a study, which investigates the question: How do teacher education policies match teacher education practices in Anglophone West Africa? Teacher education policy in this chapter refers to action statements in verbal or written form made by national education authorities/agencies about teacher education, while teacher education practice refers to the work that teachers do. Using the method of research synthesis, multi-layered, purposeful sampling of various data sources, Boolean and non-Boolean search strategies, qualitative and quantitative analytical procedures, the study identified over a hundred documents. Out of these, 77 documents met the criteria for inclusion in the study. The distribution of research outcomes by Anglophone West African countries were as follows: 18.2% were on Gambia, 27.3% were on Ghana, 10.4% were on Liberia, 24.7% were on Nigeria, and 19.5% were on Sierra Leone. From this research synthesis, it is evident that there is a gap between teacher education policy and practice in Anglophone West Africa. Most teacher education policies are 'add-on,' meaning that they were formulated as part of a larger national policy framework on basic, secondary and tertiary education. In addition, the research synthesis found that Gambia, Ghana, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are very similar in terms of their pre-service teacher training models, but differ in their in-service and professional development systems, while Liberia has a slightly different in-service model with varying durations. The limitations and implications of the findings for further comparative and international education research are discussed in the chapter. Adapted from the source document.",

Teacher education policy in this chapter refers to action statements in verbal or written form made by national education authorities/agencies about teacher education, while teacher education practice refers to the work that teachers do. Using the method of research synthesis, multi-layered, purposeful sampling of various data sources, Boolean and non-Boolean search strategies, qualitative and quantitative analytical procedures, the study identified over a hundred documents. Out of these, 77 documents met the criteria for inclusion in the study. The distribution of research outcomes by Anglophone West African countries were as follows: 18.2% were on Gambia, 27.3% were on Ghana, 10.4% were on Liberia, 24.7% were on Nigeria, and 19.5% were on Sierra Leone. From this research synthesis, it is evident that there is a gap between teacher education policy and practice in Anglophone West Africa. Most teacher education policies are \"add-on,\" meaning that they were formulated as part of a larger national policy framework on basic, secondary and tertiary education. In addition, the research synthesis found that Gambia, Ghana, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are very similar in terms of their pre-service teacher training models, but differ in their in-service and professional development systems, while Liberia has a slightly different in-service model with varying durations. The limitations and implications of the findings for further comparative and international education research are discussed in the chapter.\\n",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The gist of this study was to examine the human and resource preparedness to provide effective guidance and counselling (G&C) services in secondary schools in Bureti Sub County, Kericho County, Kenya. The study used combinations of descriptive survey and correlation research designs. Stratified sampling technique was employed to select 20 principals and 20 heads of G&C department while simple random sampling technique was used to select 400 students yielding a sample size of 440. Questionnaire, interview schedule and document analysis guide were used to collect data for the study. The study established that approximately two thirds of the practicing school guidance and counseling personnel did not have the required qualifications of diploma and above. Guidance and Counseling facilities were too inadequate to facilitate effective implementation of G&C services in most schools within the study locale. Based on the findings, it was recommended that regular workshops on G&C for public secondary school teachers and other service providers be intensified to enable them improve significantly in pedagogy and effectiveness. The importance of professional self-development and upgrading for teacher effectiveness through self-sponsored workshop attendance should be encouraged. These findings are significant to teacher counselors, Principals and the Ministry of Education Science and Technology as it will enable them to enhance G&C services in schools and achieve the set objectives of school guidance and counseling program in schools.",

The objectives of the study: to determine the influence of staff recognition; shared leadership by teachers; participation in staff development programmes; and head teachers' support for the teachers on performance.\\n\\n              \\nDesign/methodology/approach\\n\\n              \\n- The study design was descriptive survey involving 186 teachers and 32 head teachers from Koibatek district. The instruments comprised of a questionnaire and an interview guide. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, and presented using tables and pie charts.\\n\\n              \\nFindings\\n\\n              \\n- Recognition of teachers and good working conditions enhance teachers' performance. Shared leadership between teachers and head teachers has a positive effect on teacher performance Teachers' professional growth enhances performance. The teachers who receive head teachers' support such as teaching materials are more motivated enhancing performance.\\n\\n              \\nResearch limitations/implications\\n\\n              \\n- Administrators of schools should often recognize teachers. The Board of Management, Teachers Service Commission, and head teachers should provide opportunities for shared leadership. The Quality Assurance and Standard (QAS) Directorate, need funds to engage teachers in in-service courses.\\n\\n              \\nPractical implications\\n\\n              \\n- Teachers should be supported by providing teaching resources and ICT, and be given opportunities for advancement by government agencies.\\n\\n              \\nSocial implications\\n\\n              \\n- Teachers should be recognized through appreciation and other incentives during prize giving days and assemblies. Teachers be given responsibilities and freedom to act to develop abilities.\\n\\n              \\nOriginality/value\\n\\n              \\n- The research shows teacher motivation as a means of enhancing performance for quality management.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "© Emerald Group Publishing Limited. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to determine the effects of head teachers' motivational practices on teacher performance in public secondary schools in Kenya. The objectives of the study: to determine the influence of staff recognition; shared leadership by teachers; participation in staff development programmes; and head teachers' support for the teachers on performance. Design/methodology/approach: The study design was descriptive survey involving 186 teachers and 32 head teachers from Koibatek district. The instruments comprised of a questionnaire and an interview guide. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, and presented using tables and pie charts. Findings - Recognition of teachers and good working conditions enhance teachers' performance. Shared leadership between teachers and head teachers has a positive effect on teacher performance Teachers' professional growth enhances performance. The teachers who receive head teachers' support such as teaching materials are more motivated enhancing performance. Research limitations/implications - Administrators of schools should often recognize teachers. The Board of Management, Teachers Service Commission, and head teachers should provide opportunities for shared leadership. The Quality Assurance and Standard (QAS) Directorate, need funds to engage teachers in in-service courses. Practical implications: Teachers should be supported by providing teaching resources and ICT, and be given opportunities for advancement by government agencies. Social implications :Teachers should be recognized through appreciation and other incentives during prize giving days and assemblies. Teachers be given responsibilities and freedom to act to develop abilities. Originality/value: The research shows teacher motivation as a means of enhancing performance for quality management.",

The required skills correspond with workplace realities marked by creativity and innovativeness rather than transmission and consumption of knowledge. To change the current practice there is need to re-focus and align to both interactive teaching and the requisite skills of 21st century addressed in the following critical questions; are approaches used for teacher preparation relevant to modern teaching?

    "Abstract (AB)": "© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015. This study explored the role of the teacher’s digital literacy (TDL) among other schools’ digital culture (SDC) components in determining Digital Divide (DD) among Ghana’s basic schools. A paper-based survey was conducted with teachers and head-teachers from randomly sampled 17 basic schools in various locations in Ghana. The questionnaire was adopted from the Institute for Capacity Building – UNESCO and EU rubrics for measuring ICT in education; and explored nine Digital Culture components including TDL. Data were analysed using K-means Clustering, Correlation analysis, Discriminant analysis, and Independent-samples T-test. The schools were clustered based on SDC components into two DD groups; the principal influencing factors were Teachers’ digital literacy and ICT related policy documents. The school groups particularly differed based on whether they not only had the digital literacy competences, but also applied these competences in their teaching and professional development in schools. We argue that in spite of training for TDL, many schools still lack other digital culture components, and this may hinder them in applying ICT in their schools.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The importance of leadership in organizations has increased and leadership training and development has advanced and peoples' performance. Institutions in higher education are investing heavily in advancement of leadership programs aimed at improving learners' leadership skills and scholars. To this day, many scholars in higher institutions acknowledge the changing complexities in higher learning and urge to teach students new paradigms of leadership (Roberts, 1917). Many leaders have agreed leadership is both a skill and a learned behavior hence critical role of post-secondary education in learners' transformation. This paper seeks to explore professional approaches to learning and practice in relation to addition to providing information and knowledge for a greater sustainable future through leadership in Kenya. It post-examines the end products of education as a benefit to the society. A shift of teaching methodologies alongside learners' ability for leadership results for total transformation.",

The paper focuses on the PE teaching policy, PE learning facilities and equipments, and the teachers' efficiency in preschool PE curriculum implementation. Nairobi and Nyeri Counties were purposively sampled to provide a geographical comparison. The survey involved 99 preschools selected using stratified random and simple random sampling. The respondents included 60 head teachers, 99 teachers, 60 parents and 4 DICECE officers who were selected using stratified and simple random sampling. Data was collected using questionnaires, interviews, observation schedules, resource checklists and documentary analysis. The data was analysed using content analysis and descriptive statistics such as; frequency and percentages. It was found out that the implementation of the preschool PE curriculum was not efficiently done since PE lessons were used to teach other activity areas and teachers mostly supervised children playing instead of giving instructions. PE learning facilities were found to be fairly adequate. PE equipment and materials were found to be inadequate and this was mostly attributed to lack of funds. The teachers were found to be professionally trained thus competent to implement the PE curriculum though professional development programmes such as seminars and workshops were lacking. Recommendations made were that PE should be taught like all other activity areas and the Ministry of Education inspectorate unit should ensure that this is adhered to in all preschools. Provision of adequate PE learning facilities and equipment should be a requirement for all preschools. All preschool stakeholders should be sensitized on the importance of PE and seminars and workshops should be held regularly for the preschool teachers.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This paper is based on a cross-sectional survey on the efficiency of the implementation of the Physical Education (PE) curriculum in Nairobi County and Nyeri County preschools in Kenya. The paper focuses on the PE teaching policy, PE learning facilities and equipment, and the teachers' efficiency in preschool PE curriculum implementation. Nairobi and Nyeri Counties were purposively sampled to provide a geographical comparison. The survey involved 99 preschools selected using stratified random and simple random sampling. The respondents included 60 head teachers, 99 teachers, 60 parents and 4 DICECE officers who were selected using stratified and simple random sampling. Data was collected using questionnaires, interviews, observation schedules, resource checklists and documentary analysis. The data was analysed using content analysis and descriptive statistics such as; frequency and percentages. It was found out that the implementation of the preschool PE curriculum was not efficiently done since PE lessons were used to teach other activity areas and teachers mostly supervised children playing instead of giving instructions. PE learning facilities were found to be fairly adequate. PE equipment and materials were found to be inadequate and this was mostly attributed to lack of funds. The teachers were found to be professionally trained thus competent to implement the PE curriculum though professional development programmes such as seminars and workshops were lacking. Recommendations made were that PE should be taught like all other activity areas and the Ministry of Education inspectorate unit should ensure that this is adhered to in all preschools. Provision of adequate PE learning facilities and equipment should be a requirement for all preschools. All preschool stakeholders should be sensitized on the importance of PE and seminars and workshops should be held regularly for the preschool teachers.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The study investigated into the relationship between the quality of teachers and students' academic performance in Sekondi Takoradi Metropolitan Assembly (STMA) Junior High Schools. Descriptive survey design was used and the target population was Junior High School teachers and pupils in the metropolis. Five educational circuits in the metropolis were randomly selected for the conduct of the study. Stratified and systematic sampling techniques were used to sample participants and the sample size was 500. Questionnaire was the main instrument used for the data collection. Pearson Moment Correlation, ANOVA, means, percentages and standard deviations were used to analyse the data. The results of the study showed that even though the quality of teachers was high in terms of their academic and professional qualifications, it did not reflect much in the performance of the students.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Most Kenyan high school dropouts do not have a school reentry option, and without a high school diploma, they lack access to tertiary or higher education institutions for training and career development. This case study was an investigation of how an adult learning center in Kenya educated high school dropouts and helped them to gain access to vocational training or higher education. The research questions addressed the pedagogy, learning experiences, and curriculum of the Baraka Adult Learning Center (BALC) and also focused on how the BALC met students’ aspirations, needs, and goals based on the perceptions of teachers and adult learners. The conceptual framework was based on liberatory education theory, transformative learning theory, and andragogy. Data collected from classroom observation s, curriculum review, and interviews with 9 current students, 3 former students, 5 teachers, and the principal were analyzed inductively by sorting and coding to generate emergent themes. The results of the study indicated that instructors followed the regular high school curriculum with little adaptation and lacked training about teaching adult learners and self-directed learning approaches. The adult learners perceived returning to school as getting a second chance. A professional development project for BALC instructors was developed to address some of the needs identified in the study. This training could have an impact on the adult learners by better assisting them to gain access to vocational training and higher education.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This study explores the introduction of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in Kenyan secondary schools. Specifically, it is a case study of four schools with no previous access to ICT. The professional development programme from which data for this study were drawn was designed to support teachers learning to integrate ICT in the curriculum. Using a mixed-method research approach, the authors collected data from multiple sources and triangulated the views of various stakeholders: questionnaires with teachers, focus groups with teachers, school leaders and ICT coordinators, field observations and document analysis. While the broader programme focused on the use of ICT, the results highlighted in this study focus on the development of the four schools with respect to 1) vision building, 2) leadership, 3) collaboration, 4) expertise and 5) access to adequate resources. The discussion centres on the challenges and opportunities inherent in understanding how to prepare schools in developing countries to integrate ICT in education.\\n",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Assessment is considered a powerful tool for improving learning outcomes and education quality. However, limited empirical research on classroom assessment exists in many developing countries including Ghana. This study explores the issues of mathematics classroom assessment in Ghana. Specifically, it investigates and analyses mathematics teachers' views and practices of assessment with specific reference to the implication for learning. Although the main focus of this study is on teachers' assessment practices, an examination of their conceptions of the nature of mathematics is undertaken to facilitate an in-depth understanding of teachers' views and practices. The research is mainly qualitative by design and employs both interpretative and exploratory strategies. Classroom observations, semi-structured interviews and document reviews are used as instruments for data collection through a non-participant observation method. A purposive sampling method is used to select six participants: four teachers and two headteachers for the study. This research study explores key factors affecting assessment practices in mathematics classrooms. In particular, it provides an analysis firstly of teachers' views about assessment emphasising improvement and accountability and secondly of the different types of knowledge, beliefs and attitudes of the mathematics teachers, and their relationship with practice. Attention is directed to the teacher's practical knowledge of teaching, of mathematics and how assessment comes into play. Also notable is the importance attached to the teachers' beliefs concerning the nature of mathematics. Findings from this study show that teachers use both formal and informal assessments in mathematics classrooms although formal assessment dominates practice. Teachers' views about assessment and their conceptions of the nature of mathematics are related to their classroom practices. Beyond these two factors, this exploratory study illustrates how teachers' assessment practices are affected by a number of contextual factors which are related to institutional policies, professional development and classroom conditions. There are implications of this research for the implementation of assessment for learning in Ghana. It is evident that in the current context, the widespread implementation of assessment for learning is ambitious and would demand well-defined and context-specific approaches to classroom practices. The introduction of these innovative assessment practices marks a significant departure from traditional practice and as such may require regular professional support and a coordinated and collaborative effort from policy makers, schools and teachers.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Adolescent suicide is now a major health concern for many countries. However, there is paucity of systematic studies and lack of official statistics on adolescent suicide in Ghana. Mass media coverage of adolescent suicide (even though crude), at least, may reflect the reality of the phenomenon. With an ecological orientation, this study used qualitative content analysis to analyse the pattern of 44 media reports of adolescent suicide in Ghana from January 2001 through September 2014. Results showed that hanging was the dominant method used. The behaviour usually takes place within or near the adolescent's home environment. The act was often attributed to precursors within the microsystem (family and school) of the deceased. This study serves a seminal function for future empirical studies aimed at deeper examination of the phenomenon in order to inform prevention programmes.

E-mail: josaforo@hotmail.co.uk              Adolescence--defined in this study as the period between the ages of 10 and 19 years--is a period within the life span when significant physical, cognitive, and socio-emotional changes and challenges occur. Among the myriad challenges that occur during this development period is suicide, which is now a major health concern for many countries (Pompili, Innamorati, Girardi, Tatarelli, & Lester, 2011). Yearly, across the world, it is estimated that 71,000 adolescents die due to suicide and up to 40 times as many adolescents attempt suicide, ranking suicide as the third major cause of death during adolescence (WHO, 2011a, 2014). Significant differences exist in the prevalence and epidemiological pattern of suicide (committed by children, adolescents, and adults) across gender, race, countries, and cultures in the world (Ayyash-Abdo, 2002; Osafo, 2011). However, in Ghana, there are no official statistics on the phenomenon of suicide--as an independent cause or form of death (Eshun, 2003; Knizek, Akotia, & Hjelmeland, 2011). For example, the 2010 Ghana's population and housing census report by the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS, 2013) provides an omnibus statistics of death by suicide, violence, accident, and homicide. The report shows 18,938 deaths recorded and categorized under deaths by accident, violence, homicide, or suicide within 12 months preceding the census. Thus, the report merges, rather than isolates the statistics in respect of deaths by accident, violence, homicide, and suicide. However, a recent anecdotal and journalistic report shows that about 1556 people (approximately five people daily) commit suicide annually in Ghana (Citifmonline, 2012).              Similarly, official statistics on adolescent suicide in Ghana is lacking. According to the children, adolescents, and young people in Ghana segment of the Ghana's 2010 population and housing census report (GSS, 2013), 6467 deaths were recorded among young persons within the age range of 12-19 years, representing 35% of all deaths categorized under deaths by accident, violence, homicide, or suicide among young persons (between the ages of 12 and 34 years) within 12 months preceding the census. Hjelmeland et al. (2008) observe that close to half (47%) of university students in Ghana know someone who has attempted suicide and one in five know someone who has killed themselves. Analysis of police-recorded data by Adinkrah (2012) shows that 9.1% of all fatal and non-fatal suicides recorded between 2006 and 2008 involved adolescents (individuals aged between 10 and 19 years). Anecdotal statistics by the Network for Anti-Suicide and Crisis Prevention shows that 531 youngsters (aged between 9 and 19) commit suicide annually in Ghana (Kokutse, 2012). Although these statistics appear staggering and somewhat unreliable, they can be described as the tip of the iceberg because \"the fear of social stigma could restrain families and other people from reporting a suicidal person to the police as well as giving a true verdict of the cause of death\" (Osafo et al., 2011a, p. 1). The implication is that adolescent suicide has become a daily reality in Ghana (Knizek et al., 2011).              This study thus set out to conduct a situational analysis of adolescent suicide in Ghana through a qualitative content analysis (QCA) of online media news reports of adolescent suicides in Ghana through the lens of the ecological theory of human development (Belsky, 1980; Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Garbriano, 1985). Furthermore, it aimed to add to the search for the epidemiological trends of adolescent suicide in Ghana. Owing to the paucity of systematic studies on adolescent suicide in Ghana, it is hoped that the outcome of this situational analysis will serve a heuristic and seminal function for much broader sociodemographic and epidemiological enquiry into the phenomenon aimed at uncovering the nuances regarding experiences, perceptions, causes, risks, protective factors, prevention, and support systems in the future.              The ecological approach to the study of adolescent suicide              Suicide literature is replete with several theories (e.g., biological theories, psychological theories, sociological theories, and social psychological theories--such as social learning theory and the family systems theory), which guide and help researchers to structure and provide explanations for their findings. Adolescent suicide is multicausal and may be seen as the consequence of the challenges emerging out of the interplay of biological, psychological, developmental, psychiatric, social, cultural, and family environmental forces at work in the transition from childhood to adulthood (Borowsky, Ireland, & Resnick, 2001; Bridge, Goldstein, & Brent, 2006; Garbriano, 1985). Therefore, a more robust and multidisciplinary model is required to establish a thorough understanding of adolescent suicide (Bridge et al., 2006). In this vein, some adolescent suicide researchers (e.g., Ayyash-Abdo, 2002; Henry, Stephenson, Hanson, & Hargett, 1993) have recommended the application of the human ecological model (Bronfenbrenner, 1977, 1979). The human ecological model appears to be a good fit for the understanding of adolescent suicide because it is a framework that allows for the integration of the array of previous work on adolescent suicide and their families within a single model. As argued by Henry et al. (1993), contrary to the traditional theories of adolescent suicide, the human ecological model is a multidisciplinary approach to understanding adolescent suicide that integrates individual, family, and social system forces, which may be associated with adolescent suicidality within the broader environmental context rather than emphasizing specific risk factors.              Bronfenbrenner (1979) refers to the ecology of human development as involving \"the progressive, mutual accommodation between an active, growing human being and the changing properties of the immediate settings in which the developing individual person lives\" (p. 21). Bronfenbrenner sees the environment as a series of nested structures, which includes, but transcends, home, school, and the neighbourhood settings within which developing individuals spend their daily lives. Within this model, adolescent suicide is seen as emerging from the adolescent's interactions and interdependencies within hierarchically arranged, multiple-level ecological contexts (Henry et al., 1993). The layers within the ecological model include the individual, microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, macrosystem, and chronosystems, all in concentric circles (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006). The individuallevel encompasses the individual psychological and personal historical characteristics of the suicidal adolescent (e.g., depression and substance abuse). Within the microsystem, the focus is on the patterns of the roles, activities, and personal relations that adolescents have in the face-to-face settings that form their particular social encounters (e.g., family, school, and peer groups). The layer of the mesosystem concerns the interactions between several microsystems within which children shift between various roles as a result of moving between one microsystem to the other (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006). For an adolescent, this includes the relations among home, school, neighbourhood, peers, and teachers. The exosystem is the social setting that indirectly affects adolescents when they interact with some structures in their microsystem. Adolescents are not directly participating or involved in these social settings, but the process and experiences there affect their development (e.g., formal organizations such as parents' workplaces, their religious institutions, and health and welfare services in the community). Thus, any resource made available by the exosystem will either work to enrich or impoverish the quality of interactions within the micro- and mesosytems (Harper & Carver, 1999). The macrosystem consists of government; policies; laws and customs of one's culture, subculture, or social class; broad and social ideologies; and values and belief systems. Berk (2006) argues that the priority this system gives to adolescents' needs affects the support they receive at inner levels of the environment. Thus, opportunity structures and life-course options for the child exist within this system (Muus, Velder, & Porton, 1996). The chronosystem covers the sociohistorical conditions, transitions, and changes in individuals and their environment across time. Thus, it reflects the dynamic environmental transitions, encompassing entries, exits, milestones, and turning points over time in the life of the child (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006).              Although the ecological model is a good fit for the present study, the nature of the data set used (media news reports on adolescent suicide in Ghana) limits the levels of analysis to the individual, microsystem, and macrosystem. The focus of this study is, therefore, on how forces within each of these three layers present and help to identify and understand the trends and risks factors of adolescent suicidal behaviour in Ghana, as reported in the mass media. The application of the ecological approach (which combines the correlates of adolescent suicide in an interactive and additive way) in this study can yield a great advantage. As observed by Ayyash-Abdo (2002), the approach deviates from the tendency to concentrate solely on adolescent personal history (e.g., depression and hopelessness) and additionally shows adolescent suicide as a consequence of an interaction among multiple factors (personal, interpersonal, and sociocultural), which are directly or indirectly connected to adolescents.              News culture of suicide in Ghana              Act 29, Section 57, of Ghana's criminal code stipulates that, \"whoever attempts to commit suicide shall be guilty of a misdemeanour\" (Criminal Code of Ghana, Act 29, Section 46 1960). This code, thus, criminalizes attempted suicide in Ghana. Hence, individuals who attempt suicide are subject to arrest and prosecution, and are made to face criminal penalties upon conviction (Adinkrah, 2013; Kahn & Lester, 2013; Knizek, Akotia, & Hjelmeland, 2011; Osafo et al., 2011a). Therefore, like all other forms of crime, suicide is newsworthy (Pirkis, 2009; Romer, Jamieson, & Jamieson, 2006; Sisask & Värnik, 2012). There are over 40 regular newspaper titles, more than 160 FM radio stations, and nearly 10 different free-on-air TV stations in Ghana (Gadzekpo, 2010). This implies that an appreciable number of media avenues exist for information dissemination and discussions of public health issues including suicide. However, it has been observed that, generally, newspapers and other media houses in Ghana are poorly capitalized, poorly staffed, and many are slightly more than cottage industries (Gadzekpo, 2010). The implication is that generating investigative news reports and covering a wide range of specialized subject matters (including complex public health issues such as suicide) is severely hampered. The logic and practice of journalism in Ghana is known to be characterized by fierce competition determined by a mixture of political motives and commercial interests. Thus, the features of competition and commercialization associated with the Ghanaian media appear to, subtly but significantly, influence media houses and journalists as to which events or issues to consider newsworthy.              There is a plethora of evidence that certain types of news coverage of suicide can increase the probable recurrence of the phenomenon (contagion, copycat, or Werther effect) in vulnerable groups--particularly, adolescents (e.g., Gould, Kleinman, Lake, Forman, & Midle, 2014; Niederkrotenthaler et al., 2009; Pirkis, 2009; Pirkis, Burgess, Francis, Blood, & Jolley, 2006; Romer et al., 2006; Sisask & Värnik, 2012; Stack, 2005). Generally, media coverage of suicide cases in Ghana can be described as sensational, explicit, and overly simplistic (Osafo, Hjelmeland, Knizek, & Akotia, 2012); a situation, which deviates from recommended best media practices in the reportage of suicide (Center for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 1994). Media coverage of suicides in Ghana often carries sensationalistic headlines and/or prominent placement; they are often allocated front pages, centre spreads, or back pages with images of the suicidal person. Detailed explicit description of the place and method used and identity information of suicidal persons (e.g., name, location, and name of school or workplace) are also detailed and where a suicide note is left, the content is reported, sometimes verbatim. Additionally, quoting or interviewing police, parent, teacher or head of school, neighbour, or first responder about the causes of the suicide prominently features in media coverage of suicide in Ghana. However, strikingly absent from media coverage of suicide in Ghana are the voices of mental and medical health professionals; information on prevention; and education on warning signs, treatment services, and coping skills--a practice described by Osafo et al. (2012) as deficient and narrowed suicide reportage.              Despite these shortcomings, the mass media coverage of suicide, in general, and adolescent suicide, in particular (even though crude), at least, reflects the reality of the phenomenon, given the dearth of scientific research on the phenomenon in Ghana. Not all cases of adolescent suicide get media coverage, though. Online news stories can, however, offer valuable qualitative research data (Schreier, 2012; Sisask & Värnik, 2012). Thus, the Ghanaian mass media is still capable of stimulating discussions and scientific research on adolescent suicide in Ghana and remains an important channel for suicide prevention communication, empowerment, and continuous proactive public psycho-education on suicide.              Methodology and data source              Ghana is located north of the equator, on the west coast of sub-Saharan Africa. It shares borders to the east and west with Togo and Côte d'Ivoire, respectively. The Gulf of Guinea occupies the south and Burkina Faso shares borders with the north of Ghana. Ghana is largely heterogeneous in terms of language, ethnic, and religious groupings. According to the GSS (2013), approximately 71% of Ghana's population is Christian, 18% is Muslim, 5% adheres to African Traditional religious beliefs, and 6% identifies as belonging to other religious groups or without any religious beliefs. According to the 2010 Population and Housing Census (GSS, 2013), Ghana's population stands at 24,658,823 of which 22.4% represents adolescents (persons between the ages of 10 and 19 years). The proportion of male population classified as adolescents is higher than that for females. The urban-rural variation shows that in the rural areas, 24.4% of the male population is represented by adolescents aged 10-19 years compared to 21.4% of the females. A little less than a quarter of all persons in Ghana are adolescents aged 10-19 years with two in every five persons in Ghana being less than 15 years and almost one in four, an adolescent. Thus, Ghana has a largely youthful population: children, adolescents, and youth constitute a greater proportion of Ghana's population and are exposed to a number of physical, social, mental, and reproductive health risks and challenges (GSS, 2013).              The media sources used for this study are the websites of popular newspapers, FM stations, and some general news agencies in Ghana. The newspapers are Daily Graphic, Daily Guide, and the Ghanaian Times. The FM stations are Joy FM and Peace FM. The general news agencies are Ghanaweb and Ghana News Agency. All three selected newspapers (Daily Graphic, Daily Guide, and the Ghanaian Times) are the key newspapers in Ghana (Prah & Yeboah, 2011). Daily Graphic (graphic.com.gh) is a state-owned daily newspaper, which mirrors a news culture of covering officialdom as it is read by policymakers and other influential leaders. It is the most widely circulated newspaper in Ghana (Gadzekpo, 2010). Daily Guide (dailyguideghana.com) is a privately owned newspaper representing what can be considered as a well-known newspaper in the country (Gadzekpo, 2010). The third newspaper, the Ghanaian Times (ghanaiantimes.com.gh) is a state-owned newspaper aimed at business as well as social and political issues and was chosen for this study because it represents what can be described as a specialized newspaper. Joy FM (myjoyonline.com) and Peace FM (peacefmonline.com) are the most listened to commercial, popular, and leading Ghanaian radio stations in Ghana (Adinkrah, 2014; Prah & Yeboah, 2011). The websites of Ghanaweb (ghanaweb.com) and the Ghana News Agency (ghananewsagency.org) provide detailed stories about topical news of issues including health; business and economics; politics; science; education; and sports.              The sample for this study was made up of all cases of adolescent suicide in Ghana published on the websites of the selected newspapers, FM stations, and general news sites from January 2001 to September 2014. An archival search of the website of each of the selected media sources was done using keywords such as \"suicide,\" \"adolescent suicide,\" \"teen suicide,\" \"youth suicide,\" and \"student suicide.\" This search generated a pool of news reports on suicide--in general--across the specified period. Each news story generated through the search was scanned with the purpose of identifying and separating news reports on adolescent suicidal behaviour from other suicidal cases (e.g., suicides involving younger children and adults), cases of domestic and school accidents, adolescent self-injurious behaviours without suicidal intentions, and other adolescent injury-related deaths (Ohene, Tettey, & Kumoji, 2010). In total, 44 adolescent suicide news stories spanning January 2001 to September 2014 were identified and drawn from the websites of the selected newspapers, FM stations, and news agencies.              Analysis of data              The 44 media reports on adolescent suicide drawn were subjected to QCA (Burnard, 1996; Graneheim & Lundman, 2004; Schreier, 2012) in an effort to determine the dominant trend and pattern of the phenomenon in terms of prevalence, sociodemographic characteristics, causes, risk factors, and methods used. The QCA proceeded in the four-stage approach suggested by Burnard (1996). At the first stage, each of the authors independently read and re-read all the 44 cases of adolescent suicide drawn from the selected media sites in order to be familiar with the reports and to manually note as many plausible initial \"open codes\" as possible across the entire data set. The coding was both data-driven (i.e., the coding frames matched the specifics of the data set) and theory-driven--the ecological approach to human development was applied to develop the levels of analysis of coding frames (Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Schreier, 2012). The second stage focused on reading the materials more closely as a research team and agreeing on a set of initial codes we considered very relevant to the data in order to reduce the number of words and phrases so as to produce a manageable list of headings that account for all the data in the materials. Third, we integrated the relevant generated initial open codes that were similar to preliminary codes to aid the search for categories and emerging themes to help explain larger sections of the data. We collated all the preliminary codes and sorted them into meaningful units showing possible themes. At the fourth stage of the analysis, we reviewed and refined the themes and selected extracts, which supported and described the themes. Additionally, we sought to find explanations to the emerged themes and categories in the light of theory, previous related studies, and the general Ghanaian sociocultural context. Generally, to improve validity of the interpretations and findings, codes and themes were thoroughly discussed and agreed upon by all authors before further analyses were done. These cross-validation and group interpretations were to reduce bias and increase the credibility and trustworthiness of the findings (Whittemore, Chase, & Mandle, 2001).              Findings              Trend of adolescent suicidal behaviour              Over the study period from January 2001 through September 2014, a total of 44 adolescent suicides were reported on the websites of the selected media sources. Of this number, 40 cases, representing 90.9%, were completed suicides and 4 (9.1%) were attempted suicides. As shown in Figure 1, the incidence of adolescent suicide assumed an upward spiral increase in 2012 with more completed than attempted suicides. Seven cases were reported in 2012, representing 15.9% of all the 44 cases reported over the study period. Of the seven cases, six were completed suicides and one was an attempted case. In 2013, eight cases (representing 18.2%), all of which were completed suicides, were reported. As of the end of September 2014, 11 cases (representing 25% of all 44 cases) had been reported. Similarly, all the adolescents involved in these 11 cases died through the act (completed suicides).              Fig 1              Figure 1.  Curve of cases of adolescent suicide from January 2001 through September 2014.              Important demographics              The mean age of the girls was 15.4 years, whereas that of the boys was 16 years. Of the identified and selected cases of adolescent suicides over the study period, more boys than girls (54.5%: 31.8%) attempted (6.8%: 2.3%) and completed (47.7%: 29.5%) the act. The sex of six completed cases (13.6%) was not reported. Regarding the method used to complete or attempt the act, hanging was the most common (72.7%), followed by poisoning (11.3%) and slitting (2.3%). The methods used in six cases (13.6%) were not reported. Of the girl suicides (31.8%), 25% used hanging, 4.5% poisoned themselves, and the method used by 2.3% was not reported. Among the boys (54.5%), 45.4% hanged themselves, 6.8% used poisoning, and 2.3% used slitting. Thus, there was no significant difference between boys and girls in the methods used to complete or attempt the act (Table I). Thus, the majority of the fatalities were through hanging and poisoning. This diverges slightly from the firearm means among adults reported by Adinkrah (2012). Those who completed or attempted the act through hanging made use of rope, cloth, wire, or sponge (nylon net). Those who adopted poisoning ingested weedicides or pesticides; and slitting involved the use of a nail or other sharp objects.              Table I. Gender and method used.

Analysis of the identified and selected adolescent suicide news reports further showed that the home was the most commonly used location (61.3%) for suicidal behaviour among adolescents. Farms and uncompleted or abandoned buildings near the home or school were also found to be places where adolescent suicidal behaviours occurred (Table II). Typical instances of the act at home and in uncompleted or abandoned buildings involved hanging from a rafter of ceiling in bedroom, sitting room, bathroom, or suicide's own room. On farms, the suicide was hanging from a branch of a tree. Adolescent suicides who poisoned themselves were commonly found at home.              Table II. Place of act.

On the educational background of adolescent suicides, more than half (63.6%) of all the media reported cases across the study period involved adolescents in school. Of this percentage, 15.9% were in primary school, 22.7% were in junior high school (JHS), and 25% were adolescents in senior high school (SHS). Overall, 4.5% of the reported cases involved dropout adolescents (Table III). The educational backgrounds of 14 (31.8%) were not reported. These staggering statistics appear to suggest that the school setting presents some pathways or risk factors to adolescent suicide in Ghana.              Table III. Educational background.

Adolescent suicide occurred irrespective of their living situation--whether the adolescents were living with both parents, single parent, extended relations, or living alone. Overall, 20.4% of the adolescent suicides were living with both parents, 38.6% were living with a single parent, and 11.3% were living with (at least an) extended relation (Table IV). The living situation of 25% of the adolescent suicides was not reported. It is, thus, evident that living with a single parent is a suicidal risk factor for adolescents. Another notable observation evident in Table IV is that 70.3% of the reported cases involved adolescents who were living with their parents (single or both) or extended relations. This makes one wonder as to whether parents and significant others living with adolescents observed any warning signs of suicide among their adolescent wards.              Table IV.

About 34% of all the adolescents who engaged in the reported suicidal behaviours showed signs of their intention to complete or attempt the act (Table V). These signs were in the form of directly observable changes (11.3%), verbal threat to engage in the act (20.4%), and previous attempt of suicide (2.3%). Another notable development shown in Table V is that parents and some significant others reported that adolescent suicides (n=22) did not show any sign of suicidal crisis. However, even adolescents who issued verbal suicidal threats (n=9) and those who showed clear behavioural changes (n=4) all died. It is a plausible conclusion then that parents are not paying attention to suicidal threats and this might reflect the reported negative and trivial attitudes towards suicidal behaviour in Ghana (e.g., Osafo et al., 2011b).

Narratives of motivation              Motivation for adolescent suicide refers to the reasons given for the adolescent suicidal behaviour (Bridge et al., 2006). In this study, the search for the motivation covered both assigned and confessed reasons, which accompanied the news reports of the phenomenon on the websites of the selected media sources. The assigned reasons were those reasons suggested by the police, significant others (e.g., parents, peers, and neighbours), or the media source for an adolescent suicidal behaviour. Confessed reasons were those reasons given by the suicidal adolescent. These confessions were in the form of suicide note, confession before death (especially in cases of self-poisoning), or the adolescent's confession following an attempted suicide. The narratives of motivation for adolescent suicidal behaviours were organized around five subthemes: psychological factors, conflictual relationships, loss of significant other, poor school work, and socio-economic factors.              Psychological factors: Some adolescents (13.5%) engaged in the suicidal behaviour because of psychological distress and unwanted pregnancy. Some of the adolescents (9.0%) were reported to have shown signs of psychological distress prior to their suicidal behaviour. For instance,              Mother of the suicide (boy, 19 years) told the police that on the fateful day, she returned from the market at about 7:30 pm and met her son moody. She questioned him, but he remained dumb-founded only to wake up the following morning to see the lifeless body of her son. (reason assigned by significant other)              Similarly, it was reported in another case that,              The deceased (girl, 17 years), who was on vacation, appeared very depressed and was showing an unusual behaviour at home. But when her mother inquired to know what was wrong with her, she did not open up. Friends of the suicide told the mother that she was perhaps showing signs of depression because she could not write her terminal examinations. (reason assigned by police)              In both narratives, the adolescents were perceived to have experienced some form of depression. This finding appears to be consistent with the observation by WHO (2011b) that psychological distress and depression is the single largest contributor to the worldwide burden of mental health problems and diseases for people aged 15-19.              Unwanted pregnancy was found to be a notable reason for suicidal behaviours among boys who had impregnated a girl. This reason accounted for 4.5% of all the cases over the period. For example, it was reported in one case that,              The deceased (boy, 17 years) killed himself because the families of two girls, on separate occasions, informed him that he had impregnated their daughters and that he was going to be a father in some few months. (reason assigned by police)              In another case, it was mentioned that, the deceased (boy, 17 years) had impregnated a 15-year old girl\" (reason assigned by significant other).              The contemporary society of Ghana expects children and adolescents to remain in school. The patriarchal nature of the society requires boys and young men to go through school or vocational training, secure good employment, and be able to pay the bride price of their potential wives before beginning to raise their own children. Pregnancy out of wedlock is generally abhorred by the society and is particularly a burden for the boy or man responsible, as he is usually required to take up the financial responsibility of caring for the pregnant woman (Sarpong, 2006). Thus, children, and for that matter adolescents, should not rush into adulthood by doing things that are considered preserve of adults, otherwise they would be punished like adults (Gyekye, 2003). It is a common social fact in Ghana that teen pregnancy brings the respective families of the boy and girl involved into moral disrepute. For adolescent boys, this can be an overwhelming challenge as indicated in the narratives above. It is possible that these boys were still in school, unemployed, and were not fully prepared to take up the roles of husbands and fatherhood.              Conflictual relationships covered elements related to parent-adolescent communication and interaction patterns difficulties within the home environment, which lead adolescents to be suicidal. Accusations and scolding, parental disapproval, and maltreatment and corporal punishment were identified as characterizing such conflictual relationships. Accusations and scolding involved parents (or guardians of adolescents) being hostile to and levelling accusations against their adolescent children. Some adolescents (18.1%) were engaged in suicidal behaviour because they were either accused of and/or scolded by their parents or guardians for a behaviour the parents or guardians considered to be wrong. For instance, in one completed suicide report, the adolescent (girl, 19 years) narrated in her suicide note as follows:              Mother says I had an abortion and when I dress to school, I go about having sex with men. This is not true. I know that my own sister hates me because of this and mother as well, so I am ending it all ... I can never in my life kill even an insect, let alone an abortion. (extract from suicide note)              In another instance, the police coroner reported that, \"the suicide (female, 10 years) reportedly killed herself after she was scolded by her mother for misbehaving.\"              Children in Ghana are socialized to be obedient to their parents and to respect their elders. They are also exhorted to submit to parental control, advice, or authority (Gyekye, 2003). However, the parents of the adolescents in the narratives above seemed to have exercised their right to parental control but did not demonstrate respect for the views of their adolescent children on the purported misbehaviours.              Some adolescents (18.1%) were engaged in suicidal behaviour because their parents disapproved of their peer friendships and relationships. In one case, a media source reported that, \"distraught over persistent calls by his mother to end a relationship with a woman older than him, a third-year student (aged, 19 years) of a senior high school has hanged himself.\" In another case,              A neighbour reported that the deceased (female, 14 years) threatened to take her life if her mother refused to hand over her phone. He explained that her mother seized the phone because she suspected the deceased of communicating with boys. (reason assigned by neighbour)              The behaviour of the parents involved in the above narratives find explanation in the Akan maxim (which is also subscribed to by many other ethnic groups in Ghana) that, \"one has not been an elder before but one has been a child--before\" (Gyekye, 2003, p. 86). In other words, because children are inexperienced in life, their parents or elders (who have rich life experiences) do not only know what is good for them but are the best people to choose what is good for them. Thus, as indicated in the above narratives, a parent's disapproval of an adolescent's choice of friends, even if based on mere suspicion, means that friendship must be dissolved by the adolescent child. This socio-cultural authority and position of \"I know what is best for you\" of parents that underpin parental disapproval of adolescent friendships appear to serve as a precursor to adolescent suicide.              Maltreatment and corporal punishment was assigned as the reason for 11.3% of all the reported cases of adolescent suicides across the study period. In all the cases attributed to this factor, the suicidal adolescent was maltreated and given corporal punishment by a parent, guardian, or a significant other. For example, it was mentioned in a completed suicide news report that:              The deceased (boy, 15 years) allegedly stole GH¢4.00 from his grandfather and was given some lashes by his uncle while the auntie threatened to report the matter to his school authorities for further punishment. The next day, the adolescent refused to go to school for fear of being punished by authorities. He committed suicide later in the day. (reason assigned by police)              In a case of an attempted suicide, the adolescent told the police investigating the case that, \"he (boy, 16 years) was living with his father and wanted to take his life because his father maltreated him and did not cater for him\" (reason assigned by police).              The use of corporal punishment and other forms of maltreatments (usually, misconstrued as helping to correct wrong behaviours) still characterize the parent-adolescent interaction in Ghana (Ananga, 2011). Traditionally, in the parental role of raising children, parents are expected to discipline their children and be firm in dealing with them (Gyekye, 2003). However, as indicated in the narratives above, some parents unnecessarily resort to the use of some dehumanizing measures (such as flogging, starving, refusing to pay school fees, etc.) as means of disciplining their adolescent children. The use of dialogue and parent-adolescent conference hardly characterize the resolution of parent-adolescent conflict in Ghana. Another interesting revelation in the former narrative is that one of the reasons why the adolescent committed suicide was because of the fear of being punished in school. Corporal punishment and other forms of inhumane treatments of students still exist in many basic and second cycle schools in Ghana (Agbenyega, 2006; Ananga, 2011; Lewin & Akyeampong, 2009). The mode of meting out these punishments in the schools can be psychologically disturbing and traumatizing for children and teens because the culprit is usually given the punishments in the presence of an entire class or school with peers and mates sometimes required to lampoon the culprit in the process. This is a situation which has the potential of making the punished adolescent develop a sense of shame and dishonour, a phenomenon which characterizes male suicidal behaviour in Ghana (Adinkrah, 2013).              Some of the adolescents (13.5%) took to suicide because they had lost a significant other through break-up or death of a parent. All the cases of adolescent suicide (9.0%) for which break-up was cited as the reason were reported entirely by girls who had been jilted by their boyfriends. For instance, in one adolescent completed suicide case, the adolescent (girl, 17 years) confessed to her mother (few moments to her death while on the way to hospital) that she had drunk some weedicide because her boyfriend, who lives in nearby town, had jilted her (reason assigned by significant other).              Death of significant other accounted for (4.5%) of all the cases. It was particularly cited where the adolescent had lost a (single) parent to death. For example:              The deceased (boy, 19 years) informed his friends and close associates that he wanted to 'travel' or commit suicide due to information of his father's death ... The deceased attempted ending his life once but was stopped by his friends and dormitory mates and a report was made to the Senior Housemaster of the school who took him to the school chaplain for counselling. Four days later, the body of the deceased, was found hanging on one of the teak trees in the schools' teak plantation. (reason assigned by police)              Poor academic performance was notably identified as the reason for adolescent suicidal behaviours among boys (6.8%).              The deceased (boy, 19 years) obtained grades in the just ended West African Secondary School Certificate Examinations (WASSCE) which fell short of the required eight 'As'. He took the action because his friends had eight 'As' which qualified them for admission to the medical school. (reason assigned by police)              In another case, the deceased (boy, 18 years) dropped out of a public school about 6 years ago for poor academic performance and enrolled in a private school but dropped out for the same reason (reason assigned by police).              Socio-economic factors such as parental poverty and the cultural practice of child marriage were also found to be reasons for adolescent suicidal behaviour. Parents' (especially single parents') inability to pay the school fees of their adolescent children was mentioned as the motivation for adolescent suicidal behaviour. All the identified cases (9.0%) involved only adolescent girls living with single mothers.              The deceased (girl, in SHS 2nd year) living with a single mother did not go to school on Monday because she owed school fees. The mother asked her in the morning to go to school with the promise of looking for a loan to settle the school fees of GH¢190, but the daughter committed suicide later in the day. (reason assigned by police)              The deceased (girl, 17 years) committed suicide over what was believed to be her frustration over her mother's inability to pay her school fees. (reason assigned by police)              The cultural practice of child marriage was identified as the reason for suicidal behaviour among some adolescent girls (4.5%).              A 14-year-old girl has been rescued from hanging herself, after escaping from her parents who wanted to force her into marriage (reason assigned by media source). In another news report, the deceased (a 16-year-old JHS drop-out) has committed suicide because she was forced into marriage against her wishes (reason assigned by police). The cultural practice of giving an underage girl child into marriage with an adult man (child betrothal) was very common in traditional Ghana. However, the practice still appears to have currency in some communities (in the northern) parts of Ghana although the influence of education (i.e., formal classroom education) has led to a general incessant decline in the practice among the various ethnic groups in the country (Nukunya, 2003; Serra, 2009). It is now common knowledge that the practice, apart from it being a right and child abuse issue, prevents the girl child from growing and developing her full potential even as an adult. Thus, some girls who are unable to find better ways of escaping the practice resort to suicide.              Discussion              The present study provides a situational and seminal analysis of the phenomenon of adolescent suicide in Ghana through the analysis of media news reports of 44 adolescent suicide cases from January 2001 through September 2014. Analysis of demographic characteristics and trends showed that adolescent suicide has become an everyday reality in Ghana characterized by an upward spiral increase with high fatality rate. Furthermore, the suicidal adolescent was found to be in school, living with (at least) a parent or extended relation, and typically commits the act by self-hanging at home or within its immediate environs. More adolescent boys, than girls, attempted and completed the act. The search for the motivation behind the act among adolescents showed the following notable factors: psychological factors, conflictual relationships, loss of significant other, poor school work, and socio-economic factors.              The narratives of motivation behind the act fit well with the ecological model of human development (Ayyash-Abdo, 2002; Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006; Henry et al., 1993). The psychological motivations can be placed at the individual level as the categories identified represent personal characteristics and historical events of the individual adolescent. Thus, in the present study some of the adolescents became suicidal by virtue of their individual psychological and personal historical characteristics of distress and unwanted pregnancy. More than half of the adolescents were students. Recent studies have reported high incidence of psychological distress, depression, and anxiety disorders among students in Ghana (Canavan et al., 2013; Oppong & Andoh-Arthur, 2014).              The reasons of conflictual relationship and loss of significant other can all be placed within the concentric circle of the microsystem layer. The specific factors identified are those found within the home and school settings. These factors influence adolescent suicidality because the patterns of roles, activities, and personal relations of adolescents in this layer involve face-to-face interactions and direct social encounters. It is evident from the present study that microsystem reasons account for more cases of adolescent suicidal behaviours than any other level of analysis.              Socio-economic factors (associated with poverty and the cultural practice of child marriage) can be found within the macrosystem. Ghana is a lower middle income level country with some communities and families struggling to exit abject poverty. The situation is even much difficult for single parents raising school-going children. Quarshie (2011) found that macrosystem factors such as poverty and the cultural practice of child betrothal (child marriage) in Ghana are notable precursors to children and adolescents taking to street living and other life styles, which are potentially harmful to their psychosocial well-being.              Conclusion and implications              It can be concluded that the observed increase in adolescent suicide in Ghana in recent years may be attributable to motivational forces and risk factors found, largely, within the microsystem and the macrosystem--forces that are beyond the individual adolescent. A few recommendations can be made based on the findings of this study for prevention and risk reduction programmes, and reporting adolescent suicide cases in the media. First, the present study has shown that the majority of suicidal adolescents are students, hence teacher gatekeeper programmes on screening for at-risk adolescents in school can be instituted. Gatekeeper training programmes have been found to be very important in any suicide-prevention programme and many early intervention programmes have used schools as the main setting for identifying and/or intervening with adolescents (Pompili et al., 2011). Teachers can be trained on the use of screening tools to periodically assess students on depression (and other forms of psychological distress), current and previous suicidal ideation and attempts, and other risk factors of suicide. Students found to be showing clinically significant symptoms of the risk factors can be referred for professional attention.              Curriculum-based programmes on education and awareness about suicide can also be introduced in schools in Ghana. Health education programmes about suicide in schools have been found to generally help dispel the myths, increase the correctness of knowledge (including signs) of adolescent suicide, and encourage the attitude of help-seeking when necessary (Pompili et al., 2011). Any such curriculum approach should focus on destigmatizing suicide and identifying suicide as a complicated psychological reaction to a number of overwhelming factors (Lasear, Roggenbaum, & Blase, 2003).              Crisis service providers including psychologists, social workers, and other mental health professionals can collaborate with schools to educate and train parents to enhance parenting skills, knowledge, and confidence. This collaborative gatekeeper training of parents has been found to be effective in adolescent suicide prevention (Pompili et al., 2011). In this strategy, parents are provided with information regarding warning signs, risk factors, protective factors, community resources, and what to do following adolescent suicidal crisis within the home environment. Again, this effort helps parents to improve their communication patterns with their adolescents and encourages parents to move from negative to positive interpretations of adolescent behaviours (Pompili et al., 2011).              Finally, the upward increase in the incidence of adolescent suicide in Ghana calls for the education of members within the wider community on the phenomenon. As suggested by others (e.g., Osafo, Akotia, Andoh-Arthur, & Quarshie, in press), community psychologists, social workers, and community mental health workers have to intensify community psycho-education to reduce the public stigma and the attitude of triviality towards suicide in Ghana. On reporting adolescent suicide in the media, the police, public officials, and journalists should carefully explain that the final precipitating event was not the only cause of a given suicide. Most persons who have committed suicide have had a history of problems that may not have been acknowledged during the acute aftermath of the suicide (CDC, 1994). Therefore, journalists and other role players in the Ghanaian media should be educated and trained on reporting suicide as the present style of reporting (described earlier) can, potentially, have a copycat effect on vulnerable adolescents. An investigation is already underway by the authors of this paper in an attempt to establish any evidence of copycat effect of the present reporting style of suicide by the media in Ghana to warrant any such training.              Limitations              Media reports (including online news stories) of adolescent suicide do not represent official reports or national authoritative data, partly because they are fraught with reporting biases, exaggeration, and sensationalism (Sisask & Värnik, 2012). Thus, a critical look at the present study shows a few limitations and methodological challenges, which may undermine the generalizability of the findings. First, not all cases of adolescent suicide get media attention (Osafo et al., 2012), a factor which might have led the authors to underestimate the actual trend and scope of the incidence of adolescent suicide in Ghana. Second, journalists fall on police verbal report at the scene of the suicide to feed their news reports. Attempted suicide is a crime in Ghana (Adinkrah, 2013; Osafo et al., 2011a), and this fact can limit the amount of causal explanations a journalist can obtain from the coroner at a suicide scene as too much information divulged can \"inhibit\" police investigation to unravel the \"true\" cause of the suicide. Third, the methodology utilized did not allow the researchers to adequately explore the protective factors associated with the phenomenon, at least from the perspective of attempters in general. The narratives of motivation for the act provided in this study were largely suggested or assigned by the police and significant others. Despite these limitations, the study provides useful insights and a seminal point of departure for a broader rigorous systematic enquiry into adolescent suicide to establish the trends, and to understand adolescent suicidality risk factors and other correlates to help build an empirical basis for intervention, risk reduction programmes, and prevention strategies of the phenomenon in Ghana.

    "Abstract (AB)": "Ghana, like many developing countries, has fewer trained, qualified teachers than the number the country needs to realise the Education For All goals of quality education by 2015. The failure of Ghana's teacher education sector to turn out sufficient numbers of qualified trained teachers is as a result of numerous factors including existing Colleges of Education (CoEs) not having enough facilities to train the high number of untrained teachers (UTs) through the traditional campus-based model and difficulty of access to teacher education places. In response to these limitations, the Teacher Education Division, with the support of the CoEs, adopted an alternative pathway for initial teacher preparation known as Untrained Teachers' Diploma in Basic Education (UTDBE) in the latter part of 2004. This model of initial teacher preparation differs from the traditional campus-based model as the training is largely non-residential with limited provision of face-to-face meetings. After four years of implementation, key stakeholders, notably the top hierarchy of Ghana Education Service and the Ministry of Education, were calling for the extension of the programme by way of admitting another cohort of students. However, it was clear from my perspective as a senior professional involved in Teacher Education and with seven years of professional knowledge and experience in Distance Teacher Education that there was a lack of in-depth, theoretically-informed research into the programme, particularly with respect to the views of UTs themselves. The study was therefore designed using an in-depth case study approach to discover the views of UT participants on how the UTDBE had influenced their professional development and the quality of their teaching and learning, with a particular interest in the view of six UTs who were the direct beneficiaries of the programme. The research methods adopted were predominantly qualitative, and included observations and analysis of documents, a series of interviews with selected UTs, including focus groups and one-on-one interviews in which UTs reflected on videos they had taken of their practice. The findings suggest the potential of the UTDBE as a source for teachers (especially, those in underserved communities and locations) to learn, develop, update their skills and knowledge and improve instructional practices consistent with learner-centred approaches and professional practices. In addition, the opportunity that the UTDBE offers UTs to teach as classroom teachers while completing their professional programmes seems to have given them the chance to at least integrate and relate theoretical knowledge and experiences from CoEs to the practical realities in the classrooms and schools. However, the data indicated a number of challenges facing the UTDBE programme which undoubtedly affected the extent to which it promoted professional and personal development and learner-centred practices. These included (i) inability of the programme to take advantage of professional learning experiences that might be possible ICTs were introduced (ii) weak district, school and college collaboration (iii) the difficulties and complexities in managing relations between UTs and mentors (iv) tutoring during residential face-to-face meeting devoted to large group lectures (v) the over-loaded nature of course content and the difficulty and loaded nature of the content of some modules (vi) inability of UTs to make maximum use of college facilities (vii) other mechanisms of professional development such as cluster meetings and lesson observation not being used to their full potential (viii) largely non-recognition of the ‘wisdom of practice' of UTs and (ix) tensions in expectations between the different communities of practice of the different contexts of training and practice. The thesis therefore makes an important contribution to our knowledge about the development of alternative forms of teacher education in such contexts.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "In the last two decades, the global community and government of several countries have made heartening investments in promoting access to education in developing countries. It is estimated that since the reaffirmation by world leaders and development community to achieve education for all by 2015 in Dakar, Senegal, governments and donors have invested about US $15 billion annually in education. Despite the huge financial investments, empirical evidence shows that education outcomes remain low among school children in developing countries and key stakeholders in the education sector identified weak and ineffective supervision as one of the major factors responsible for the low educational outcomes. This study therefore examines the professional skills of school supervisors in ensuring effective teaching and learning in Ghanaian basic schools. Using the Ga South Municipality as a study area, I specifically explored the professional backgrounds of school supervisors, examining their recruitment and training processes, field experiences, and how they apply their professional knowledge to the school supervision process. Employing a purely qualitative case study approach under pinned by the concept of social constructivism, I engaged 7 school supervisors, 5 teachers/headteachers, 2 directors of education and 2 PTA/SMC members. I used in-depth interviews, observations and documentary reviews as the methods of data collection. The study made the following findings: With regard to the professional background and qualification, the supervisors who participated in the study are well qualified and experienced in the field of education. They are all trained professional teachers with over 10 years of classroom teaching experience. They also held Bachelor's Degrees; however, not all of them have pursued degree programmes in the field of education. Majority of them specialised in fields such as political science, sociology, human resources management, psychology, and history – and none had received any formal training in education administration or supervision. The supervisor recruitment process is characterised by the phenomenon of neo-patrimonialism where political and traditional authorities use their influence and power to mount pressure on education officials to select their preferred candidates (mainly party faithfuls) as supervisors. Any resistance from an education director is interpreted as seeking the downfall of the political head and his or her administration. In terms of skills training, there is no formal pre-service and in-service training (INSET) programme designed to enhance the professional development of supervisors in the skills of supervision. Supervisors were reliant on peer training and support (both skills development and material) from non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to build their professional capacity. Training provided by NGOs were governed by their philosophies or that of their donor partners rather than the sector policies of the Ministry of Education and GES. The study also revealed that even though supervisors have the knowledge in the field of education, they are deficient in the ‘technical' and ‘interpersonal skills' necessary for effective supervision in schools. There is also a general lack of material resources necessary for efficient supervision of schools. Based on these findings as a whole, the study recommended an intervention in the form of a comprehensive policy to govern basic education supervision; the initiation of education supervision training programmes in pro-education specialisation tertiary institutions such as the University of Cape Coast (UCC) and the University of Education Winneba (UEW); and a clear framework to control and coordinate the activities of NGOs working in the field of education management and supervision in Ghana.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "What should be considered when developing a literacy intervention that asks teachers to implement new instructional methods? How can this be achieved with minimal support within existing policy? We argue that two broad sets of considerations must be made in designing such an intervention. First, the intervention must be effective by bridging the gap between current teacher practice and the scientific literature on effective instruction. This broad consideration is detailed with 10 design recommendations. Second, the intervention must be amenable to being scaled-up and mainstreamed as part of government policy. This involves being (i) simple and replicable; (ii) well received by teachers; and (iii) cost effective. The paper describes how these factors were considered in the design of a literacy intervention in government primary schools in coastal Kenya. It also includes reactions from teachers about the intervention and their change in knowledge. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\\n",

    "Abstract (AB)": "© 2014 Elsevier Ltd. What should be considered when developing a literacy intervention that asks teachers to implement new instructional methods? How can this be achieved with minimal support within existing policy? We argue that two broad sets of considerations must be made in designing such an intervention. First, the intervention must be effective by bridging the gap between current teacher practice and the scientific literature on effective instruction. This broad consideration is detailed with 10 design recommendations. Second, the intervention must be amenable to being scaled-up and mainstreamed as part of government policy. This involves being (i) simple and replicable (ii) well received by teachers; and (iii) cost effective. The paper describes how these factors were considered in the design of a literacy intervention in government primary schools in coastal Kenya. It also includes reactions from teachers about the intervention and their change in knowledge.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "© 2015 IIMC International Information Management Corporation Ltd. This paper explores the concept of digital divide (DD) in Ghana's basic schools in Sekondi-Takoradi Metropolis in Western Region. We tested the ICT culture variables as well as school location factor in respect to school's digital divide. A survey sample contained 17 regional city schools from three different locations - central city in the region, towns away from the central city, and village schools. The survey instrument was developed with ten ICT culture variables. The variables in the instrument met the Cronbach's Alpha threshold value of α = 0.70. Data was analysed with Descriptive statistics, Hierarchical Cluster analysis, Independent t-test, and Canonical discriminant analysis. We found that school location did not determine the schools DD, nonetheless the schools were digitally divided, - 2 clusters were found among schools. This DD was determined by certain ICT culture variables: Teacher's ICT competences and the usage of ICT in Teacher's professional practice were paramount.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The purpose of this study was to examine whether the theory of the Quality-Quantity tradeoff of children applies in the Kenyan context. Specifically, this study focused on four research questions: (a) What relationships may exist between investment in children’s education and children’s educational achievement?; (b) What relationships may exist between family size and children’s educational achievement?; (c) What relationships may exist between family size and investment in children’s education?; and (d) Does investment in children’s education have a moderator effect between family size and children’s educational achievement?    To answer these research questions, the Kenyan SACMEQ III data set collected in 2007 was used. During the data review process, a total of 4,170 observations from 193 schools in eight regions were selected for further analyses. To check the suitability of the data for examination using selected statistical methods, several preliminary analyses were conducted. Findings revealed that the data met assumptions needed in order to use regression models.    Findings for each research question were as follows: (a) investment was a significant predictor of educational achievement; (b) number of siblings was a significant predictor of educational achievement; (c) number of siblings and investment had inverse relationships; and (d) investment was a significant moderator between number of siblings and educational achievement in models for both reading and math literacy when using OLS—however, results for the moderator effect of investment were inconsistent between models for reading and math literacy when using HLM.    Based on these findings several future studies were recommended to promote Kenyan human capital development practices under VISION 2030. These included taking a look at: (a) the impacts of educational circumstances on promoting educational achievement, such as fewer tasks at home and more physical accessibility to the school; (b) the use of determinant factors rather than family size in examining resource allocation differences in reading/math literacy, especially with regard to a gender gap; (c) the influential factors in improving school quality, such as teachers’ professional training, that lead to high-quality teachers and benefit children’s education; (d) the crucial factors at the region level that lead to differences in educational investments and outcomes; and (e) the use of multiple wave data sets and/or longitudinal data to examine the impacts of educational investment and its influence on achievement within/between generations, including enrollment in secondary school/vocational training in order to increase labor market value and labor force status.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "© 2015 by the authors. Current understanding of disaster risk reduction (DRR) concurs that, when provided the right education, children have the potential to reduce their own vulnerability and the vulnerability of others in their community. What, then, comprises the right education for DRR? Research has established the need for disaster education to address the causes and effects, prevention and response, and management and recovery from disaster events. The educational process must include diverse and practical techniques that reinforce disaster knowledge and builds a culture of safety and resilience amongst students. Drawing on syllabus content analysis and field research in two rural communities in semi-arid Northern Ghana, this study explored the presence and nature of DRR within the syllabi of the basic school system. By comparing the result of the content analysis with results from interviews and questionnaires completed by teachers and students, significant gaps were identified between the disaster pedagogy outlined in the syllabi (theory) and that which occurs in the classroom (practice). It was realized that while the theory outlines active and innovative techniques for teaching, learning, and evaluating DRR lessons, various challenges hinder the practical application of these techniques in the classroom. The study concludes that a lack of teacher training and professional development, and inadequate teaching and learning materials, generally account for these results. A new and consolidated effort is required from all stakeholders to train teachers and to provide the appropriate learning materials to improve on the current DRR education.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "© 2015 A. Buckler. All rights reserved. This book provides an analytical exploration of the condition of teachers working in expanding school systems across the world, with a particular focus on the lives of women teachers in rural Sub-Saharan Africa. Drawing from award-winning research, it looks beyond the official portrayals of teachers' lives in order to better understand the reality of the contexts in which teachers live and work. Positioning Amartya Sen's capability approach at the heart of the study, each chapter considers documentary evidence alongside ethnographic research from rural, remote and under-resourced schools in Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa and Sudan. Interweaving rich narratives from teachers in a variety of contexts, the book proposes a concept of professional capability and examines female teachers' agency to pursue and achieve this in their classrooms. This key examination challenges existing notions of 'quality education' and reveals insights into the broader purpose of schooling for rural communities. Quality Teaching and the Capability Approach will be of value to researchers, academics and postgraduate students in education, particularly those concerned with gender, development and teaching, as well as educationalists and policy makers concerned with education and development.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This paper reports on the development and outcomes of the second phase of OER4Schools, a school-based professional development programme supporting interactive forms of subject teaching in conjunction with Open Educational Resources (OER) and technology in Zambian primary schools. We worked with partners to identify the needs of school-based continuing professional development adapted to the local context; the programme was based on participatory, collaborative and inquiry-based pedagogies for both classroom learning and teacher development. We worked over a one-year period with four experienced teachers in two basic (primary) schools serving disadvantaged communities. Data were collected from observations, interviews, surveys, lesson planning/review meetings and team workshops. All participants integrated OER and technology into mathematics and science lessons and developed more interactive practices, including collaborative learning. Professional dialogue, quality conversations, reflective practice, cultural sensitivity, peer learning and cooperation were pivotal mechanisms through which teachers shifted their focus from teaching (and teacher exposition) to student learning. Seeing students as capable individuals, teachers raised their expectations and developed insight into interactive practices such as group work, providing meaningful opportunities for student collaboration and active learning by all.\\n",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The purpose of this study was to develop better understanding of professional learning communities (PLCs) and how they have evolved over the years as a comprehensive school reform to improve teachers’ knowledge, skills, and instructional practice as well as students’ achievement during accountability periods. It also explored whether learning communities had democratic principles as their foundations. The study revealed how learning communities had evolved historically, conceptually, and theoretically. It also revealed that with commitment on the part of principals and teachers, and principals distributing leadership, PLCs were very effective in enhancing the knowledge and instructional strategies of teachers, and improving students’ learning. There was a change in the culture of schools that implemented PLCs as the habits and minds of teachers transformed in their day-to-day classrooms activities. Further, the study revealed that through common vision, collective participation in discussion, collective decision making, listening to the views of teachers in their groups, considering minority perspectives, and the opportunities provided for the voices of teachers to be heard exemplified democratic principles in PLCs. I reviewed teacher education/collaboration in several countries: Ethiopia, Namibia, Ghana, Japan, China, and Singapore. Finally, I suggest ways in which PLCs could be harnessed to change teacher professional development if implemented in the Ghanaian educational system to improve teachers’ instructional practice and students’ learning outcomes.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Conditions of learning are critical in determining quality of education. There have been real concerns raised by stakeholders regarding the quality of education for pastoralists in public primary schools in Kajiado Central District in Kenya. Interventions have been put in place to address the issue of quality education. One such intervention is the Dupoto-e-Maa education project. The study investigated the extent to which the project has promoted quality educations in terms of institutional capacity in the public primary schools in Kajiado Central District. The evaluation used both cross-sectional survey and phenomenological research designs. Phenomenological research design provides in-depth information about individuals, groups or institutions as they naturally occur. This design helped generate qualitative data through information gathered from head teachers, School Management Committees (SMC), teachers, pupils, Quality Assurance and Standards Officer (QASO) and project staff. The cross-sectional survey design assisted the evaluators to access quantitative data from a wide range of informants. A sample size of 183 respondents was selected using purposive sampling as well as stratified random sampling procedures. Head teachers of the sampled schools participated as key informants. The instruments of data collection used in the study included questionnaires, interview guide, document analysis guide, Focus Group Discussion (FGD) guide as well as observation guide. From the analysis it was concluded that Dupoto-e-Maa education project had significantly contributed to improved institutional capacity in terms of installing new facilities in schools as well as rehabilitating the existing ones. They were also involved in teacher training programs as well as stakeholders' awareness campaigns. The study recommends that the Constituency Development Fund (CDF), the County Government of Kajiado and the Government of Kenya (GoK) should allocate/commit more resources for improved infrastructure as well as in-service training and professional support of teachers. The findings could also be used to inform policy dialogue with regard to education for pastoral communities.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Recent Early Grade Reading Assessments in Ghana have shown extremely low reading proficiency rates in the early grades of primary school and poor teaching quality misaligned with the national literacy curriculum. Applying a gap analysis framework, this case study examined 15 teachers’ reading instruction in five primary schools in the Akuapim North district of Ghana. The primary purpose of the case study was to identify the knowledge, motivational, and organizational barriers that are preventing teachers from effectively implementing the national literacy curriculum and to develop context-relevant solutions to address the gaps. Data was collected through surveys, interviews, document analysis, and classroom observations of teachers in kindergarten and first grade. Findings showed that teachers lack factual knowledge and self-efficacy to teach reading skills. Teachers also lack procedural knowledge for implementing child-centered pedagogies and formative assessments. The study confirmed a number of assumed organizational barriers, such as insufficient teacher training, inadequate coaching in the classroom, and limited opportunities for professional engagement with peers. An extensive literature review of proposed solutions indicated that continuous training of up to 80 hours and consistent coaching in the classroom coupled with professional learning communities that use student achievement data as the basis for instructional planning can have a significant impact on student reading outcomes. Furthermore, the selection and training of coaches is critical to the success of the professional development program. The proposed solutions in Chapter 5 provide concrete strategies for addressing the teacher performance gap. The paper concludes with a detailed implementation plan and an evaluation framework for monitoring the effectiveness of the proposed continuous professional development program.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This dissertation examined the state of senior high school (SHS) music and dance education in the context of a growing economy and current socio-cultural transitions in Ghana.  The research analyzed the experience of educational administrators, teachers, and students.  Educational administrators included professionals at educational organizations and institutions, government officials, and professors at universities in Ghana.  Teachers and students were primarily from five SHSs, across varying socioeconomic strata in the Ashanti Region, the Central Region, and the Greater Accra Region.  The study employed ethnographic and multiple case study approaches.  The research incorporated the data collection techniques of archival document review, focus group, interview, observation, and participant observation.  Four interrelated theoretical perspectives informed the research: interdisciplinary African arts theory, leadership and organizational theory, post-colonial theory, and qualitative educational methods' perspectives.  The incorporation of multiple theoretical frameworks allowed for diverse perspectives on education to be acknowledged.  The dissertation consists of five chapters, which include an introduction, literature review, methodology, presentation of findings, and analysis.  The major findings of this study are organized into five thematic categories that examine: (a) the significance of music and dance education in Ghanaian SHSs, (b) the challenges of music and dance education in Ghanaian SHSs, (c) the influence of Ghanaian economic development on music and dance education in SHSs, (d) the role of educational administrators, teachers, and students in decision-making regarding music and dance education in Ghanaian SHSs, and (e) Ghanaians' vision of the future of music and dance education in SHSs and the recommendations offered by study participants.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Regular participation in physical activity can improve students' health and academic achievement. It is important to develop a positive attitude toward participation in regular physical activity early in life. Thus, an understanding of factors that affect the activity levels of young children is essential. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to examine what kindergarten teachers perceived as barriers to teaching movement and physical activity. Participants included a purposive sample of 79 teachers from one district in the Upper West Region of Ghana. An 11-item served as the main data source. The questionnaire utilized a 5-point Likert scale. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results showed class sizes ranging from 12-161 pupils per teacher. The teachers identified lack of resources (62.0%), lack of support from other teachers (36.80%), lack of time (25.30%), and inadequate training (25.30%) as the major barriers to teaching movement and physical activity. Independent t-Test and One-Way ANOVA analyses found gender, class taught, and professional qualification did not significantly influence teachers' perception of barriers to teaching movement/physical activity. There is the need for teacher education institutions in Ghana to prepare early childhood physical education specialists.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "© The Author(s) 2015. This study explores informal health education with a moralistic content in three Kenyan teacher training colleges and what it means for the development of a professional identity in health education studentteachers on a continent affected by far the largest number of health problems. Informal health education with a moralistic content is a kind of non-curricular health education which exists parallel to formal health education lessons, but which influences student-teachers’ professional identity formation in complex ways by provoking resistance but also strengthening the community of student-teachers. The study used ethnographic methods and drew on a body of interrelated works in the field of sociocultural and critical educational theory and theory about professionalism to understand informal health education learning and processes of acquisition of professional identity. The findings document that in spite of institutional discipline and student-teachers’ resistance to informal moralistic health education, informal health education also initiates peer learning and identity work as student-teachers negotiate what they consider an appropriate teacher identity in the complex structures of teacher training colleges. The study concludes that these processes strengthen student-teachers’ sense of belonging to the teaching profession and thereby positively influence their professional identity.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The purpose of the study was to investigate Junior High School science teachers' knowledge about contextualised science instruction. The study employed descriptive survey design to collect data. A test, Test of Science Teacher Knowledge of Contextualised Science Instruction was developed and administered to collect data on teachers' knowledge of contextualised science instruction from 204 (180 males and 24 females) Junior High School science teachers. Descriptive and correlational data analyses were performed on the data collected. Some key findings that emerged in the study were: Majority of the teachers' knowledge about contextualised science instruction was weak but correlated positively and significantly with their highest professional qualification. A number of recommendations were made to the Ministry of education and Ghana Education Service: A policy statement should be made in the curriculum to indicate that science teaching should be contextualised. Another policy should be fashioned to compel institutions that train science teachers to include contextualisation of science instruction in their science methodology courses.",

This article explores four Kenyan primary school teachers' life-stories and narrative learning through living and telling stories about their lives from 2000 to 2011, and what this means for their relation to the teaching profession. Evidence suggests that narrative learning manifests as altered professionalism 'in' and 'through' the stories teachers tell about their lives and depends on ruptures in lived life, followed by periods of transition in life-stories. Teachers also learned narratively by recounting their life-stories. Thus, narrative learning is an important learning site and a resource for professional development in addition to pre-service teacher education.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "If children do not learn how to read in the first few years of primary school, they will struggle to complete the cycle, and are at greater risk of dropping out. It is therefore crucial to identify and test interventions that have the potential of making a large impact, can be implemented quickly, and are affordable to be taken to scale. This is the goal of the PRIMR Initiative in Kenya and the ToTAL program in Haiti--to test various options for improving learning outcomes and instruction in primary schools, using a randomized controlled design. Due to high student-teacher ratios, limited teacher training, and lack of sufficient text materials, reading outcomes for students attending Kenyan and Haitian primary schools are generally poor. There is international focus on improving literacy, including through bilateral donors such as USAID and DFID, in Kenya and Haiti. However, there is limited knowledge about how reading skills are acquired in multilingual environments such as in Sub-Saharan Africa or the Caribbean. This paper presents the findings of a longitudinal tracer study evaluating student literacy outcomes in Kenya over two years, three data collection points, and across two languages. Random selection and assignment methods were utilized to assign clusters of schools to a treatment and a control condition. The treatment group implemented a targeted literacy and numeracy instructional program. This paper also presents the findings of a two-year randomized control trial in Haiti evaluating the efficacy of a literacy curriculum for Haitian Creole and French. Both interventions included student books, teachers' guides, and ongoing teacher professional development and supervision. Analysis shows that PRIMR had a positive impact on the literacy outcomes of interest, including but not limited to letter sound identification fluency, oral reading fluency, the percentage of pupils who read at the MOE's benchmark, and reading comprehension, although not on all combinations of language, grade, and school type. The longitudinal analysis is able to determine how the language skills interact over time and across languages, and suggests that in some skills, pupils are transferring literacy skills from English to Kiswahili. This is unexpected based on the Western literature, which generally suggests language transfer in the other direction. Analysis similarly shows that ToTAL has a positive impact on key foundational skills of initial sound identification and letter sound identification, although not on all combinations of language and grade. Patterns suggest that instruction in the mother tongue of Haitian Creole led to gains in French on skills that were not explicitly taught. This research shows that teachers can be sensitive to in-service teacher professional development (ITPD) if that ITPD is closely linked to the books and lesson plans used in schools, and if teachers are observed and supported frequently.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The ability to critically evaluate information for the purpose of rendering health care is a prerequisite for modern nurses in a complex and ever-changing health care environment. The nurse educators’ perceptions influence the utilization of critical thinking strategies in the classroom. The purpose of this study was to assess nursing faculty’s perceptions of critical thinking. Using a questionnaire 106 nurse educators from two types of nursing educational program self-reported their perceptions. Data were collected from November 2013 to March 2014. Results were presented using frequencies, percentages, and t-test. The findings revealed that majority (95.3%) of nurse educators could not provide definitions that captured both affective and cognitive aspects of critical thinking. However, the majority of nurse educators had positive perceptions of critical thinking. Nurse educators in universities had more positive perceptions of critical thinking than those in the nurses’ training colleges (P=0.007). The results suggested that the current nursing programs are not preparing nurses with the necessary critical thinking skills for the complex health care environment. Professional development programs in critical thinking should be instituted for nurse educators to assist them in developing appropriate teaching strategies to foster students' acquisition of critical thinking skills.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Kenya is one of the countries whose teachers the UNESCO (2015) report cited as lacking curriculum support in the classroom. As is the case in many African countries, a large portion of teachers in Kenya enter the teaching profession when inadequately prepared, while those already in the field receive insufficient support in their professional lives. The cascade model has often been utilized in the country whenever need for teachers' continuing professional development (TCPD) has arisen, especially on a large scale. The preference for the model is due to, among others, its cost effectiveness and ability to reach out to many teachers within a short period of time. Many researchers have however cast aspersions with this model for its glaring shortcomings. On the contrary, TCPD programmes that are collaborative in nature and based on teachers' contexts have been found to be more effective than those that are not. This paper briefly examines cases of the cascade model in Kenya, the challenges associated with this model and proposes the adoption of collaborative and institution-based models to mitigate these challenges. The education sectors in many nations in Africa, and those in the developing world will find the discussions here relevant.",

As is the case in many African countries, a large portion of teachers in Kenya enter the teaching profession when inadequately prepared, while those already in the field receive insufficient support in their professional lives. The cascade model has often been utilized in the country whenever need for teachers’ continuing professional development (TCPD) has arisen, especially on a large scale. The preference for the model is due to, among others, its cost effectiveness and ability to reach out to many teachers within a short period of time. Many researchers have however cast aspersions with this model for its glaring shortcomings. On the contrary, TCPD programmes that are collaborative in nature and based on teachers’ contexts have been found to be more effective than those that are not.

    "Abstract (AB)": "Continuous professional development of teachers plays a crucial role in improving learning outcomes in schools. This study investigated how teaching time is lost when teachers absent themselves to participate in sandwich programmes to upgrade themselves in the University of Education, Winneba (UEW) in Ghana. Using a survey of 475 teachers pursuing sandwich programmes in the University and interviews with pupils and gatekeepers of schools in Effutu Municipality, it emerged that indeed, participation in sandwich programmes at UEW lead to loss of 45 days of classroom instructional time in basic schools. The academic calendars for basic schools and that of the sandwich programme overlap by 9 weeks, implying teachers who enroll in the sandwich programmes lose an average of 264 hours each of classroom instructional time with their pupils in an academic year. Other effects include inability of teachers to participate in religious and social activities such as worship, weddings and funerals. The study concludes that, although sandwich is a good approach for teachers to upgrade themselves, the existing arrangement is not favourable to the teachers and their pupils as time meant for classroom interactions are spent in the University campus on sandwich programmes. Therefore, harmonising the calendar arrangements could reduce the time loss by a minimum of 3 weeks to improve teaching and learning in schools.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of leadership styles on academic performance in Junior High Schools (JHS) in Asonomaso Nkwanta in the Kwabre District Assembly of Ashanti Region in Ghana. The design for the study was a mixed study using both the qualitative and quantitative analyzes. It was a correlation survey designed to establish the relationship between leadership styles and academic performance in schools in Asonomaso Nkwanta in the Kwabre District Assembly. Data collected on the leadership styles of the school leaders were the independent variables and the academic performance as dependent variables. The data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 22 and Epi-Info, a data capturing and analysis software. The study noted that unless the headmasters are well equipped with knowledge and skills in leadership they would not know if they have any influence on their schools and on academic work. The study also established that even though respondents agreed that a leadership style can affect academic performance, the headmasters do not gain the confidence of the stakeholders enough in order to build terms that can enhance quality of teaching and learning. Based on these establishments, it was recommended that teacher training institutions should incorporate in their curriculum, training in the art and science of leadership in order to groom leaders' right from school. Again, it is recommended that compulsory continuous professional development in leadership should be institutionalized in Ghana Education Service (GES) for headmasters.",

In this article, we share findings from data collected using a MKT task questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and interpreted against the MKT proficiency status tool continuum of fluent, partially fluent, and inadequate. The teacher was the unit of analysis. Findings from the study indicate that teachers' levels of fluency were not consistent either by mathematical strand or by assessed MKT component.

    "Abstract (AB)": "The current Kenyan secondary English curriculum (2002) has adopted an integrated approach not only to teaching, but also to the assessment of English language and Literature. This re-organisation is meant to improve the standards of teaching and performance in English. However, national performance in integrated English has remained consistently below average, contrary to expectations. This paper is based on a research that was conducted in Nairobi North sub-county, Nairobi County, Kenya on \"The Promise of Integrated English: Teachers' and Head teachers' Reactions and Reflections.\" The study mainly used a qualitative approach and employed questionnaires, interview and observation schedules to collect data from 101 teachers of integrated English and 20 head teachers. Further, the heads of English at Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development, Directorate of Quality Assurance and Standards and Kenya National Examinations Council were interviewed. Raw data collected from questionnaires, interview and observation schedules were organized into significant patterns so as to easily interpret and understand the essence of the data. The study revealed that despite the promise of the re-organized English curriculum, teachers were teaching the integrated English curriculum without proper understanding of the methodology involved. Consequently, they faced difficulties and resorted to teaching English language and Literature as two separate subjects. The study concluded that there has been no effective implementation of integrated English curriculum in Nairobi North sub-county as was/is intended by the curriculum developers. The study recommends proper and continuing professional support to the teachers of integrated English curriculum in the form of in-service training for the promise to hold.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Leadership is important to the effective functioning of organizations. In education, what leaders do influences pedagogy and student learning. While knowledge on transformational leadership (TL) has been developed from transnational studies, what leaders actually do may not be the same in Ghana due to influences of contextual factors. The specific problem is the lack of knowledge on the TL practices and the factors that influence the leadership practices of the college of education (CoE) principal in Ghana. The purpose of this case study was to identify the nature of the TL practices of Ghana’s CoEs principals, the perceived factors that influence their leadership practices, and how the principals define successful CoE leadership. The study participants comprised eight principals, five vice principals, and three assessment officers. The researcher gathered qualitative data for the study using a semi-structured interview protocol in face-to-face interview sessions. Each interview session was electronically recorded for accurate record keeping and ease of transcription. Following transcription, member checking allowed participants to review and certify the accuracy of the data. Data analysis involved the identification of convergent and divergent points grouped under themes and presented as the study results. The results revealed that Ghana’s CoEs principals engaged in leadership actions under each of Kouzes and Posner’s exemplary leadership practices. Primarily, the principals model the way by focusing on getting the job done; inspire a shared vision through meetings and discussions with stakeholders; challenge the process by outlining work schedules and assigning employees roles to perform; enable others through staff development initiatives; and encourage the heart of others by recognizing and rewarding efforts as well as addressing staff welfare and professional development needs. Also, the results show that two major factors that influence the principals’ leadership practices are their personal characteristics and work contexts. To the participating principals, the number one indicator of successful CoE leadership is the active involvement of stakeholders in decision making processes and college activities. Future research must focus on the extent to which the principals apply TL and the exploration of effective leadership competencies for developing Ghana’s CoEs as the institutions become full-fledged tertiary institutions.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This study used the TIMSS 2011 International Database to investigate predictors of 8th-grade mathematics achievement across three countries that represent a wide range of cultures and levels of mathematics achievement: Chinese Taipei, Ghana, and the United States. A review of literature on predictors of mathematics achievement yielded variables in four major contexts of learning—a student’s home, beliefs, school, and classroom. The variables of home that were investigated are home possessions for learning, parent education, and parents’ expectations and involvement in their children’s education. The variables of student beliefs were self-confidence in mathematics and the value of mathematics. The variables of school were school climate, school resources, administrator leadership, and school socioeconomic status. Finally, the variables of the classroom are access and equity, curriculum, tools and technology, assessment, and teacher professionalism.   A 2-level hierarchical linear model was used to investigate relationships between the predictors for learning mathematics and 8th-grade mathematics achievement. Level 1 represented the relationships among the student-level variables, and Level 2 represented the school-level variables.   In Chinese Taipei, statistically significant predictors of mathematics achievement in the final model included variables from the domains of home resources, student beliefs, school climate, and school socioeconomic status. In Ghana, both student-beliefs variables had statistically significant relationships with mathematics achievement, and one school climate and one school socioeconomic status variable each was found statistically significant. The U.S. had statistically significant predictors in the domains of home resources, student beliefs, school socioeconomic status, classroom-level access and equity, classroom assessment, and teacher professionalism.   This study extends previous research in several ways. It includes a review of classic and recent literature regarding predictors of mathematics achievement; 17 scales using the Rasch partial credit model were developed to measure predictors of mathematics achievement; and the results of this study may be used to examine the relationships between the independent variables of this study and middle-grades mathematics achievement in countries similar to the 3 in this study to reinforce and support variables that contribute to student achievement.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Within the Tamale Metropolis, it is observed that only a few women occupy top level management positions within the Ghana Education Service (GES). A descriptive survey was therefore conducted in 2013/2014 academic year to assess the factors affecting the gender disparity in educational leadership within the Service. Specifically, the study sought to examine if factors such as low educational qualification, traditional beliefs and cultural practices were limiting to women leadership in educational institutions within the Metropolis. A sample size of 250, comprising 200 teachers and 50 administrators from selected Basic, Senior High Schools and Colleges of Education was involved in the study which used questionnaire as the instrument for data collection. The study revealed that there were more males than females in the teaching profession in the Metropolis. The male teachers also had better professional and academic qualifications than their female counterparts. Thus, more males qualify for appointment into leadership positions than their female counterparts. The situation is compounded by the cultural and traditional milieu of the people that relegates women into subservient positions in society. The study therefore recommends vigorous educational campaign through workshops, seminars and symposia for teachers, educational administrators and the general public to emphasize the importance of higher education for women as well as the important roles women could play in national development. GES council could introduce intensive family life education and gender neutral curriculum as a means of minimizing gender stereotypes and promoting progress towards enhanced gender equity within the society.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Topics: 1.) Integration of International Programs in the Engineering Curriculum (year long, semester, short term/ study abroad, co-op, and service learning) 2.) Experiential and Project-based Learning in Engineering Programs Overseas 3.) Techniques in Web-Based and Technology Enhanced Education Around the Globe\\nWith this work-in-progress paper, we report on the design of an innovative curriculum for engineering skills for low-resource pre-college students. Engineering knowledge and skills are in high demand for local and global knowledge economies and provide individuals access to social and economic mobility. However, basic engineering education is inaccessible to many students in low-income and low resource areas. Educational technology may be one component of a solution that addresses access and equity. The curriculum focuses on science and engineering problem solving within real world constructs. We adopt the Integrated Course Design for Outcome-Based Education (Streveler, Smith, & Pilotte, 2012) for this design. This curriculum comprises of four unique components: (1) using technology for access to learning modules, (2) taking advantage of the residential environment and delivering content in a flipped structure, (3) utilizing service learning by building on community needs for engineering problems, and (4) iteratively developing the curriculum in close concert with teachers and students. This course is currently designed for out-of-school youth at a residential children transition center located at western Kenya in a peri-urban agricultural area in a major urban center. We apply backward design (Wiggins & McTighe, 2005) in developing the curricular priorities and content to be delivered based on the learning objectives defined along with the center director and students. The course aims to prepare students for adaptable problem-solving, design, and evidence-based decision making. This curriculum is a unique form of experiential education based on a synergistic model in which academic objectives are integrated with community development and collaborative learning. We believe that the potential learning from this curriculum along with career development will help the students build relationships with their community and find employment opportunities. Further, this emerging ability to create their own solutions could scaffold into entrepreneurship learning and opportunities as part of future courses. The course is built on findings from previous work showing promise for increased learning outcomes from flipped classroom platforms and student-driven curricula. The paper provides an overview of the content, assessment and pedagogy, and the role of technology for the course planned.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "© 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. From the late 1960s teachers’ centres emerged in England and Wales as a popular focus for teacher professional development, bringing groups of teachers together from across a local area and offering a physical space in which they could access resources, meet other teachers and take part in a range of formal and informal opportunities for professional learning. Inspired by new directions in curriculum development and a changing educational climate during the 1960s, teachers’ centres offered a promising new conceptualisation of professional learning. This valued organic, teacher-led transformation; was responsive to local demand and expertise; and was committed to teacher autonomy. At their peak it is estimated that there were up to 700 centres operating across England and Wales. Regarded by some educationists as a distinctive movement for democratic, teacher-led professional development, but by others as incoherent, divisive and highly differentiated in terms of quality of provision, teachers’ centres divided professional opinion. My recent study of the history of teacher professional development in England and Wales 1920-2000, funded by a British Academy research grant, involved a critical re-examination of the teachers’ centre model. It also uncovered evidence that the English model influenced and was adapted in a number of other countries, including the Netherlands, Spain, Japan, South Africa, the United States (US) and Australia. Drawing upon new oral history testimony and archive material, this chapter outlines the teachers’ centre model of professional development and considers its contribution to an emerging international phenomenon. It examines the nature of international exchange and policy-borrowing in relation to teachers’ centres through different international networks. It also problematizes the implied contradictions in the idea of translating and possibly transplanting a peculiarly English or ‘British’ (the designation most commonly used by contemporary commentators) -based model of teacher professional development into different international contexts. Though teachers’ centres, as they were originally conceived, have now largely disappeared from the teacher professional development landscape in England, they appear to continue to thrive in a wider international arena, particularly in the US, parts of Europe, India, Kenya, Nepal and Zambia, This raises important questions about what factors contributed to their historical demise in England and Wales and what factors currently contribute to their success in other international contexts. Moreover, in revisiting the essence of the teachers’ centre model, it is argued that there is further scope for considering which aspects of teacher-led and communitybased professional development might have currency for future directions in the field.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Teachers form one of the essential professional groups in the development domain of every country. Although most senior high school teachers in Ghana complains about poor conditions of service, a lot of them are still at post. The key research goal was to explore the retaining factors of senior high school teachers, within their existing demotivating Ghanaian socioeconomic context. Eighteen individual interviews were conducted among senior high school teachers in the Eastern Region using an interview guide. By means of an Inductive Content Analysis, three major themes emerged; (a) teachers' retention factors, (b) teachers' motivation factors and (c) Helping factors. It is remarkable that, motivation to these participants did not necessarily mean job satisfaction and job retention. Intrinsic motivation was rather perceived as influencing job performance while extrinsic motivations were needed to retain them. In general, the absence of these extrinsic motives were replaced with other retention factors like less tress at work, increasing liberty at work, and absence of alternative employment opportunities.\\n",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Teachers form one of the essential professional groups in the development domain of every country. Although most senior high school teachers in Ghana complains about poor conditions of service, a lot of them are still at post. The key research goal was to explore the retaining factors of senior high school teachers, within their existing demotivating Ghanaian socioeconomic context. Eighteen individual interviews were conducted among senior high school teachers in the Eastern Region using an interview guide. By means of an Inductive Content Analysis, three major themes emerged: (a) teachers' retention factors; (b) teachers' motivation factors; and (c) Helping factors. It is remarkable that, motivation to these participants did not necessarily mean job satisfaction and job retention. Intrinsic motivation was rather perceived as influencing job performance while extrinsic motivations were needed to retain them. In general, the absence of these extrinsic motives were replaced with other retention factors like less tress at work, increasing liberty at work, and absence of alternative employment opportunities.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This research aimed to explore the variation in how teacher trainees from a non-Western educational context (Ghana) experience and conceptualize information literacy (IL) through a phenomenographic approach. The concept of IL, which originates in the West could be seen and understood differently by different information users in developing countries, including Ghana. A number of studies have begun to focus on the understandings of IL from a phenomenographic perspective, forming a new way of looking at IL from subjects’ conceptualizations of it in different contexts. This particular focus on IL in different information landscapes is seen as a way of broadening the viewpoint and creating a sound theoretical base for the concept. The present study, which is contextualized in this body of research, proposes that ideas about teaching and learning of information literacy and the way trainee teachers are educated in information literacy need to be reorganized to reflect how teacher trainees themselves conceptualize IL. There is limited research focusing on how student teachers experience, understand, and conceptualize information literacy. The study presented here investigated the experiences of 25 teacher trainees who were in their second year at the University of Education, Winneba in Ghana. Data were collected in 2012/13 through semi structured, open-ended, face-to-face-interviews. The analysis which yielded five categories of conceptions showed that, although participants understood IL, it made more sense to them in terms of the information literate teacher (ILT). The five categories describing the ILT were: having linguistic, mainly English language competence; knowing about ICTs for communication and information retrieval purposes; having critical awareness; knowledge-building and, finally, exhibiting professional growth and development. This formed an inclusive hierarchy. While none of the experiences in this study is regarded as inherently better than another, the inclusive nature of the relationships between the categories indicates that each succeeding step in the hierarchy represents a more complex and inclusive awareness of various aspects of IL. Apart from contributing to a comprehensive understanding of information literacy in general, the outcome space in particular can provide a framework for designing an information literacy curriculum to educate teachers as information literates at UEW. The contributions of this research are revealing experiences of IL in a non-Western context and illuminating the conceptions of teacher trainees.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Alongside his numerous contributions to the field of education-such as developing integrated media instructional materials for use in elementary science methods courses for prospective elementary school teachers; developing the curriculum program called HyperScience for Middle School Teachers, which involves the use of counter-intuitive events in a video format to promote students' abilities to explain numerous science phenomena; and developing training materials and methods for Peace Corps teachers working in Kenya, Zaire, Rwanda, Fiji, Liberia, and Nepal- Dr. Hofwolt was heavily involved with the MSERA.\\n\\nSpecifically, the authors, Drs. Celeste A. Wheat (University of West Alabama) and Lilian H. Hill (University of Southern Mississippi), combined a postmodern feminist theoretical framework with a pluralistic approach to leadership via a qualitative research design to examine the complex factors that influence women's experiences in senior administrative roles in higher education.\\n\\nFindings revealed that variables associated with perceived experience of mastery, perceived social persuasion, and anticipated levels of physiological arousal discriminated levels of teacher efficacy associated with classroom management, student engagement, and instructional strategies-indicating the importance of school personnel providing feedback to teaching artists.\\n\\nUsing standard multiple regression analyses, the author determined that teachers' attitude towards their professional development statistically significantly predicted schools' overall performance at the elementary and middle school levels but not at the high school level.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The study sought to determine the influence of gender, Teachers Service Commission (TSC) adherence to career progression policy guidelines and tutors' exposure to professional development on career progression of tutors in primary teachers training colleges in Kenya. This study was a descriptive survey with 264 tutors randomly sampled from eight Public Primary Teacher Training Colleges. Out of the 264 sampled, 207 tutors returned the questionnaires for analysis. Data was collected using a questionnaire for tutors, interview schedule for Principals and TSC officers. One way Chi-square and linear regression analysis (at a = 0.05 level of significance) were used to test the relationship between each variable and tutors career progression. The study found that gender was not significantly related to tutors' career progression. Further analysis revealed that exposure to professional development influenced tutors career progression positively. The study concluded that tutors' gender did not have any significant relationship with career progression. However, exposure to professional development and adherence to policy guidelines by TSC influenced career progression positively, which is positive result for this study. The study recommended that there is also need to increase the number of appointive positions in Primary Teacher Training Colleges to provide tutors with more chances of career progression. Above all the study recommended that tutors should be regularly exposed to professional development so as to update their skill and competence.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This collaborative self-study details the experiences of an Australian teacher educator and a Canadian teacher educator, who led teacher candidates on international practicum placements to the Cook Islands and Kenya respectively. Focusing on critical incidents, they collaboratively analyzed dilemmas that occurred when providing professional development sessions for local teachers during these placements. These dilemmas required the teacher educators to think deeply about their beliefs and practices in these contexts. Findings from the study included the teacher educator's tendency to make assumptions about good teaching and learning practices that were reflective of their personal pedagogical values and beliefs; their discomfort with their perceptions of some neo-colonial practices within these international practicum sites and uncertainty about how to navigate the resultant tensions; and, the need to view the work of teacher educators though a new cultural lens when working in transnational contexts. Implications for teacher educators working with local hosting teachers during international placements include the need to understand and acknowledge the complexity of this dimension of teacher educators' work, and for teacher educators to engage in parallel learning journeys with the teacher candidates they accompany. This involves critically reflecting on the experiences, assumptions, and beliefs that they bring to their new contexts, as well as adopting a global perspective and a deep consciousness of how one is perceived by others who are culturally, racially, or linguistically different.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Fitness centers require professional instructors to ensure members obtain the safest and most effective exercise classes. Certification and licensure enable fitness instructors to demonstrate a strong desire to be knowledgeable and committed to expand their capabilities and offer more diverse services to their clientele. This study therefore sought to determine whether fitness instructors in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana had the needed professional competence required to be effective as instructors. A descriptive correlational research design was used for the study. A total of 18 instructors were purposively selected from an accessible population of 45. A researcher designed appraisal questionnaire was used to gather data for the study. Three hypotheses were tested using Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient at 0.05 level of significance. The findings showed no significant relationship existed between highest academic qualification (HAQ) (\"r\" = 0.427, p = 0.077), area of study (AoS) (\"r\" = -0.385, p = 0.115, as well as years of experience (YoE) and level of knowledge (\"r\" = 0.192, p = 0.444) all 2-tailed. It was concluded that academic qualification, area of study and years of experience did significantly relate with the level of knowledge suggesting that the instructors' lack of training, certification and licensure culminated into their low levels of current knowledge in fitness instruction. It was recommended that the National Association for all Sports, Ghana and other stakeholders should develop a national plan for the training, certification and licensure of Fitness Instructors in Ghana.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Discussions around eLearning in developing countries are fraught with conflicting tensions and expectations as policy makers and advocates argue about costs, resources, program designs and the benefits of integrating ICT into schools and communities as a means to improve education for all. Educational technology or eLearning initiatives are inherently complex, expensive and challenging; they are not just about hardware and software but always require changes in policies, creation of new education resources, and provision of training and on-going support for educators. It should not be surprising, then, that research finds that technology interventions in developing countries can impact students' academic growth but that many technology programs, especially large scale programs, fail [1,2].\\nOver the last 15 years, Intel has funded researchers from the Education Development Center (EDC) to undertake multiple case studies of active eLearning programs in the US and across numerous countries. These studies have helped provide insight and guidance for Intel's many educational partners around the world. In our professional experience we have come to understand that ICT is important because of what it enables educators to do for their students; it is the educators who make the day-to-day decisions to use these technology tools to create the learning environments they envision. Thus, an information technology (IT) infrastructure is important because it provides the platform from which teachers can create dynamic, engaging and impactful classroom learning environments. In this article we build off our experience in schools all over the world to discuss key IT elements that seem to be important for educators to make changes in teaching, learning and even the structure of schooling.\\nEDC has been a research and evaluation partner for Intel's teacher training programs and educational initiatives in the US since 2000 and supporting Intel international efforts since 2003 [3, 4, 5, 6]. Over time we began doing more in-depth case studies on classroom and school-based uses of IT tools in diverse national contexts. We started these comparison studies with Costa Rica, Vietnam, Nigeria, Brazil and China [7], India, Turkey and Chile [8], and a look at Web2.0 in multiple states in the USA [9]. We have accompanied local researchers on site visits for other eLearning initiatives: Conectar Igualdad in Argentina [10], Computer for Every Child in Macedonia [11], Project Dositej in Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina [12], SPARK in Kenya [13], One Computer Per Child in Turkey [14] and E-Schoolbag Project in China [15]. Our most recent set of case studies looked at different innovative IT projects combining student devices and easy Internet access: one-to-one initiatives of Todos en la Red in Argentina [16], and school-based programs in Russia [17], the eCADEMY blended high school in the USA [18] and Khan Academy in Chile [19].\\nLooking across all these case studies, we began to see five broad components of the larger IT ecosystem that combined to support teachers and students in making those innovative changes. Clearly these countries have different levels of economic development, different education systems, and different needs and challenges. The educational contexts we looked at across all these countries also had very different IT resources available, and teachers often used those resources in different ways. Yet, despite all of the variation, these experiences suggest there are some critical combinations of these components of the IT ecosystem that open up more opportunities for teachers to use IT in their classrooms. The five technology components that come together to create a powerful technology ecosystem for learning are: children's access to devices; teacher computers; Interactive Whiteboards (IWBs) or projectors; Internet access and networking capacity; and virtual learning environments or learning management systems. If one objective is to change the learning environment in the classroom, our experience suggests that computers become more powerful learning tools when they are embedded in a technology eco-system that uses the technology to overcome other deficiencies in the school.\\n",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This study investigated the challenges Form III English language teachers face when implementing the revised integrated English language curriculum. A mixed-method descriptive design was used in Eldoret East SubCounty in Kenya. Data was collected through questionnaires, interviews and reflective conversations. Cluster, purposive and random sampling were used to identify 50 study participants. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics while qualitative analysis involved transcriptions of interviews and filed notes which were coded, categorized and patterns and themes identified. The study established that lack of appropriate Teacher Professional Development (TPD), content overload and complexity, non-suitable learner characteristics, inadequate directions in course books on integration and inappropriate pre-service training affected curriculum implementation efforts. The study recommends involvement of teachers in the development of curriculum innovations, organized Continuous TPD, development of materials that support teachers in their implementation and review of assessment procedures.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "© 2016 Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience. The scientific capacity in many African countries is low. Ghana, for example, is estimated to have approximately twenty-three researchers per a million inhabitants. In order to improve interest in science among future professionals, appropriate techniques should be developed and employed to identify barriers and correlates of science education among pre-university students. Young students' attitudes towards science may affect their future career choices. However, these attitudes may change with new experiences. It is, therefore, important to evaluate potential changes in students' attitudes towards science after their exposure to experiences such as science outreach activities. Through this, more effective means of inspiring and mentoring young students to choose science subjects can be developed. This approach would be particularly beneficial in countries such as Ghana, where: (i) documented impacts of outreach activities are lacking; and (ii) effective means to develop scientist-school educational partnerships are needed. We have established an outreach scheme, aimed at helping to improve interaction between scientists and pre-university students (and their teachers). Outreach activities are designed and implemented by undergraduate students and graduate teaching assistants, with support from faculty members and technical staff. Through this, we aim to build a team of trainee scientists and graduates who will become ambassadors of science in their future professional endeavors. Here, we describe an approach for assessing changes in junior high school students' attitudes towards science following classroom neuroscience outreach activities. We show that while students tended to agree more with questions concerning their perceptions about science learning after the delivery of outreach activities, significant improvements were obtained for only two questions, namely \"I enjoy science lessons\" and \"I want to be a scientist in the future.\" Furthermore, there was a generally strong trend towards a change in attitude for questions that sought information about students' perceptions about scientists (both positive and negative perceptions). In addition, outreach providers reported that their involvement in this public engagement scheme helped them acquire several transferable skills that will be beneficial in their studies and career development. These include vital skills in project and time management, teamwork and public speaking. Altogether, our findings provide novel indications that the development of scientist-school outreach partnerships in Ghana has valuable implications for science education and capacity development.

    "Abstract (AB)": "Autistic children, characterized by impaired social interactions, impaired communication, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviors, are also entitled to education just like the other children in the society. It is therefore important that primary schools in Kenya get prepared so that the children are able to transit to schools from their homes in order that upon their landing in schools, they find a soft and friendly environment. Transition to school will enable the autistic children also to realize their full potential in life. This study focused on the primary schools preparedness in terms of; infrastructure, specialized curriculum, policy knowhow, stakeholders and trained personnel towards the transition of autistic children in Kenya. The researchers decided to use qualitative research method and a critical analysis design. The literature used was analyzed through thematic analysis and content analysis. The study finally came up with possible recommendations to be undertaken by various educational and school stakeholders as follows; every primary school in Kenya should have the autistic child friendly infrastructure so that the autistic children get their education in the integrated mainstream set-up along with their non-disabled peers and their brothers and sisters. Curriculum developers should come up with enriched curriculum to balance the need of autistic children as it also strives to his/her nondisabled peers. Ministry of education needs to avail new policies specifically for the education of the autistic children. The researchers recommend that parents and caretakers of the autistic children should be given thorough training similar to that given to the teachers to ease the transition as they will be able to handle the autistic children professionally even from home. The researchers are of the opinion that it will be a good thing if all the primary school administrators will be trained in special needs especial on how to handle the autistic children. They recommend that a further research be conducted on other areas of preparedness primary schools need to focus on in order to enhance smooth transition of autistic children from home to school.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Education in Kenya requires rethinking as the country faces the demands of educational and socio-economic transformation of the 21st century. One of the general objectives of primary education in Kenya states that primary education should provide the learner opportunities to acquire literacy, numeracy, creativity and communication skills. There is evidence from research reports that the objective has not been fully met. A number of learners go through the primary school course without acquiring the basic literacy skills which negates the focus of the country to develop a knowledge based economy. The purpose of this study was to find out the extent to which teachers used teaching learning resources and learner centred strategies in primary school classrooms. The methodology adopted was survey research design. A total of 490 primary school teachers from five counties were purposively sampled and a total of 402 teachers participated; out of the total, 70 were observed teaching and 332 filled in a questionnaire. Out of 35 TAC tutors selected, 27 participated. A total of 80% of the teachers observed teaching used teacher centred teaching learning approaches with little learner involvement. The majority, 61.4% of those who filled in the questionnaire, indicated that they used teacher centred teaching learning approaches. Only 1 (3.7%) was \"good\" in use of resources for teaching learning in class, the rest were poor or did not use resources. It was found that teaching and learning approaches employed in the classroom by most teachers was teacher centred and encouraged rote learning hence lacking in active student involvement in the learning process. It was recommended that there should be sustained school based teacher professional development activities specifically addressing pedagogy for improved curriculum implementation and ultimately improved learning outcomes.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This research is related to Education Development Trust's Department for International Development-funded Girls' Education Challenge (GEC) programme in Kenya. Complementing the monitoring and evaluation data gathered for the programme, this research was funded by Education Development Trust to enrich and develop a deeper understanding of girls' experiences at school in Kenya. It explores aspects of school and schooling that affect the participation and learning of marginalised girls in the Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs) of Turkana and the slums of Nairobi. The report offers a detailed, qualitative analysis of the practices and experience of education of 128 girls across 16 primary schools in these two regions. It examines: (1) Why marginalised girls in ASALs and slums participate and learn better in some schools compared to others; (2) Why there might be a higher proportion of girls enrolled in some of these schools; and (3) How reform can be supported in other Kenyan schools to increase enrolment, achievement and the completion of basic education for girls. The study involved visiting a total of 16 schools (eight in Turkana and eight in the Nairobi slums) for two days each in term two of the 2014 school year. Over the course of the research the team met with 128 girls, 53 2 teachers, 14 heads and two deputies, observed 53 lessons and carried out 48 'out-of-class' observations. Findings are presented in two chapters. The first gives the findings from each data source and the second presents a cross-case thematic analysis. The key points are described in this report. This report suggests that schools should consider how they collect fees, build positive relationships between female pupils and teachers, and encourage active and professional leadership in order to build better learning environments in which girls are more likely to complete schooling and do well. Schools also need to continue to address quality issues and maximise learning time during the school day, and ensure that girls are not inadvertently excluded from additional learning opportunities offered outside the school day.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This paper reports finding of the study that sought to ascertain the extent of ICT-pedagogical integration in mathematics instruction among secondary school teachers in Kenya. Information was sought on professional development experiences and needs in computer technology use in mathematics instruction, the type of computer software used in mathematics curriculum content delivery, the influence of accessibility to ICT infrastructure and technical support, teachers' competence and confidence on ICT integration in mathematics teaching and learning. This was a descriptive survey of explanatory nature that involved 200 mathematics teachers from schools who were selected using proportionate stratified sampling techniques. Data was collected using questionnaires, interview and observation schedules. The data collected was analyzed using descriptive statistics involving computation of frequencies and percentages and inferential statistics that included Pearson correlation and multiple regression analysis. Results show that there is limited use of ICTs in mathematics instruction which is attributed to low self confidence and incompetence in use of ICTs and inaccessibility to appropriate software materials and technical support. There is need to equip schools with the necessary ICT infrastructure including content specific software and technical support. There is also need for professional development of teachers in ICT pedagogy as they require the knowledge and skills to put these tools in practice.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The purpose of the study was to establish perceptions and attitudes of student teachers and their cognitive-metacognitive awareness in mathematics in colleges of education in Zambia. Although there has been abundant research into perceptions, attitudes and cognitive-metacognitive awareness in teacher education, relatively little research has focused on student teachers' perceptions and attitudes and their cognitive-metacognitive awareness in Zambia. Perception is a cognitive process through which individuals view, interpret, and understand their surroundings and environment and includes impressions formed about objects, events, and people. Attitude towards mathematics denotes interest or feeling towards studying mathematics. Metacognition is intertwined with cognition and affect. Metacognition is \"thinking about thinking\" or cognition about cognition. The key findings indicated that student teachers had moderately high metacognitive awareness levels in both colleges. According to the results of the analysis, there was not a significant difference among the scores of metacognitive awareness of student teachers (F = 0.522; p = 0.491 > 0.05) according to means. We accept the null hypothesis that the means in the two colleges of education do not vary since (p > 0.05) . Results indicated that student teachers in both colleges of education had higher levels of their perceptions and attitudes towards mathematics. Further, results from the Focus Group Discussion (FGDs) indicated that student teachers perception of their performance is attributed to lecturers' methods of teaching and lecturers' attitudes towards them. Results from the focus group with all the years of study indicated that lecturers teach them procedures of solving problem without student teachers' participation. The results showed that lecturers teach the \"how\" approach of solving mathematical problems without the \"when\" and \"why\" processes of solving problems. Therefore, this study recommends that teacher training programmes should include activities through the development and support of metacognitive awareness and affective factors that will be helpful in terms of professional and personal development for mathematics teacher trainees.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "© 2016 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  &  Francis Group. To improve learning outcomes, an intervention in Kenya called the Primary Math and Reading (PRIMR) Initiative provided pupil learning materials, teachers’ guides and modest teacher professional development in mathematics. This paper presents the causal impact of PRIMR’s mathematics intervention on pupil achievement indices for procedural and conceptual numeracy, using a differences-in-differences analytic strategy. The mathematics intervention produced modest, statistically significant results: generally similar results for males and females, a larger impact in grade 2 than grade 1, a larger impact in nongovernment schools than public schools, and smaller outcomes in mathematics than for English or Kiswahili. These findings have relevant policy implications in Kenya given an impending national mathematics programme.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "While there is a growing interest in offering international teaching practicums to preservice teachers as an approach to developing teachers' global perspectives on education, understanding of the impact of such practice on the host communities is insufficient or almost absent. Using the Theory of Change framework and data collected from multiple sources, this study examined the impact of preservice teachers' practicum on the school and community development in Kenya. By exploring the context of the host communities, the perceptions of Kenyan educators, and the changes that have occurred in Kenyan schools and communities, this study revealed positive changes in Kenyan schools as the result of hosting preservice teachers. A model of forming multi-stakeholder global partnership in higher education was presented to make the international teaching practicum a reciprocal professional development opportunity for educators in both sending and receiving countries.",

Abstract: This paper reports on the methodological approach of a study that examined an important dimension of the global challenge to better understand the ‘quality’ element of Education for All (EFA): the professional lives of women teachers in rural communities in Sub-Saharan Africa. Teachers from five countries (Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa and Sudan) provided a focus for exploring the relationship between official representations of teachers’ work and the professional lives teachers create and experience. Sen's (1999) capability approach was used as a framework for understanding this relationship and to produce two conceptualizations of professional capabilities for teachers generated by the official and teacher perspectives, respectively. These capabilities are organized around the pursuit of quality in teachers’ work. The paper explains how these two conceptualizations were determined, justifies four key aspects of the method used and highlights key insights into the teachers’ professional lives enabled by this approach.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Quality and relevant illustrations in primary school textbooks aid pupils’ learning experiences. However, some approved primary school textbooks in Kenya might contain low quality and irrelevant illustrations that inhibit their use. This study sought to evaluate the quality and relevance of illustrations in approved textbooks in Uasin Gishu County in Kenya so as to recommend strategies for determining their preparation and production. The objectives of the study were to establish the criteria for determining the quality and relevance of illustrations, to determine factors contributing to the quality and relevance of illustrations, and to examine challenges faced while dealing with illustrations. The study was guided by the gatekeeping theory. The researchers adopted an exploratory survey design involving 191 respondents. Questionnaires and interviews were used to collect data. The findings established that specific criteria for determining the quality and relevance of illustrations were lacking, and that expertise, time, technology, and printing materials were factors that contributed to the quality and relevance of illustrations. The results revealed that primary schools experienced user-related challenges, and that publishers experienced preparation and production challenges. Vetting and approving authorities’ challenges emanated from the preparation of the illustrations. Important recommendations include that adequate criteria for determining the quality and relevance of illustrations be formulated by the vetting authorities, that the preparation and production of illustrations be given professional attention by the publishers, and that government support textbook development and involvement of subject teachers from all regions in the evaluation panels. The study has implications for decolonising teaching and learning.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Faculty members and students have participated in a project based on Service-Learning methodology in collaboration with the Association for the Development, Alternative Trade and Microcredits (ADCAM) for the last three years. The project was implemented in the Educational Technology course (Education Degree) and Business Strategy course (MBA Degree). It was aimed at developing technological literacy in Pre-School and Primary School teachers and promoting entrepreneurial development in women of the Maasai community. The students created didactic material and workshops to meet the project objectives during the first stage of the project. A group of collaborating faculty members travelled to Kenya and implemented the designed material on-site during the second stage of the project. This research is the result of said project which main goal was to study the impact of the Service-Learning methodology on teaching personnel that implemented it on-site. For this purpose, various faculty members who participated in the project were interviewed and a qualitative analysis was undertaken. The research indicates that the use of the Service-Learning methodology has a positive impact on the teaching personnel who implemented it, both professionally and personally.\\n",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The main purpose of this paper was to assess teacher preparedness in the implementation of the integrated Business Studies curriculum in public secondary schools in Kenya. Specifically, the study sought to: find out the level of preservice training of the Business Studies teachers implementing the integrated Business Studies curriculum and to find out the extent of in-service training of the Business Studies teachers implementing the integrated Business Studies curriculum. This study was based on the ideas and concepts of curriculum theorists; Gross et al., (1971), Tyler, (1949), Fullan (1982) and Shiundu and Omulando (1992), who noted that, for successful curriculum implementation, the degree of success depends on the extent to which several factors would be considered. The study employed a descriptive survey design. The study took a census inquiry and thus purposively collected data from all the Business Studies teachers and head teachers of all the public secondary schools in Nandi North Sub-County. Questionnaires for Business Studies teachers and interview schedule for head teachers were used to collect data. Validity of the research tools was determined by having experienced supervisors in the School of Education, Moi University who checked the questionnaires and the interview schedule, while reliability of the research instruments was established by a pilot study. Analysis of data was done using descriptive statistical techniques. The findings of this study revealed that Business Studies teachers were trained in the orientation of the old curriculum to teach Accounting, Economics or Commerce as separate subjects with majority having been trained to teach Economics and not Business Studies as an integrated subject while about a third of the teachers were untrained. Furthermore the study found out that majority 52 (71%) of the Business Studies teachers had never received any in-service training such as seminars and workshops. This study recommends that, there is need for Teachers Service Commission (TSC) to hire more professionally trained Business Studies teachers and organize more in-service training courses. Teacher training institutions should offer relevant training program in all areas of the integrated Business Studies subject. It is hoped that the findings from this study will be utilized by the Ministry of Education and other education stakeholders in order to come up with strategies that should be put in place to enhance the implementation of the integrated Business Studies curriculum in Kenyan secondary schools.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "© 2017 International Literacy Association In many countries, educational policies typically mandate school activities that promote a homogeneous and narrow range of academic literacies for all learners despite the diverse nature of human learning. This ethnographic case study examines how a 12-year-old Kenyan fourth-grade student performing below average on all standardized tests used multiple invisible literacies while documenting his knowledge and life experiences in a rural context. Invisible literacies are covert meaning-making literacy practices that are not privileged in the classroom. Examination of these practices shows a convergence between school and home literacies, suggesting a need for education stakeholders to identify literacies that are otherwise marginalized and to reposition multilingual learners in nondeficit ways by centering and integrating these literacies. This study demonstrates that a monolithic and monolingual approach to literacy, in isolation from other visual, oral, and practical forms of literacy used by multilingual rural students, denies such learners access to and development of literacy in general.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Every year billions of dollars are spent on development aid and training around the world. However, only 10% of this training results in the transfer of knowledge, skills, or behaviors learned in the training to the work place. Ideally, learning transfer produces effective and continued application by learners of the knowledge and skills they gained through their learning activities. Some studies suggest that technology usage can serve as an effective post-learning intervention to enhance the transfer of learning.     Currently, there is a limited body of research examining the factors that hinder and promote learning transfer in professional development, particularly the professional development of school leaders in developing countries. This qualitative exploratory study sought to address the gap in the literature by examining 6 schools, 3 in Burkina Faso and 3 in Ghana, West Africa. This investigation explored: (a) if and how learning transfer took place after the leadership training; (b) what promoted and hindered learning transfer in both countries; and (c) if the use of a text message intervention after the training enhanced learning transfer. The sample consisted of 13 West African school leaders (6 in Burkina Faso and 7 in Ghana) who attended a 3-day leadership training workshop. Data collection included in-depth interviews, document analysis, post-training site visits, and text messages to ascertain whether this mobile technology intervention enhanced learning transfer.    The findings demonstrate that learning transfer occurred in both countries in all six schools. Data indicate that most of the transfer of learning happened in areas not requiring mindset and behavioral changes. Data suggest that the facilities in which the trainings took place, the facilitators’ dispositions and knowledge as well as the adequacy of the materials and the follow-up of the mobile text messaging intervention assisted the participants in transferring knowledge to their schools following the training. Participants also indicated some inhibitors to the transfer of learning such as financial, cultural, and human behavior constraints. This study helps increase our understanding of what promotes and inhibits learning transfer in educational settings in developing countries and provides suggestions for trainers and teachers who facilitate trainings.",

The reality that teachers in developing countries teach large, and even overcrowded classes, is daunting and one that may not go away any time soon. Class size in Kenyan public secondary schools is generally 40–59 students per class. This article reports initial findings on teachers’ and principals’ perspectives related to large classes. We used questionnaires, interviews and classroom observation data to examine teachers’ and principals’ perspectives regarding their capacities to teach and manage large classes; what challenges large class sizes present; and what additional supports teachers and principals perceive to be necessary.

Additionally, both teachers and principals cited a need for more support in the form of (a) professional development; (b) workload reduction; and (c) increased resources.

    "Abstract (AB)": "Young people on the global stage: their education and influence\" is an EU-funded project that involves teachers and students from three European countries (Britain, Germany and Spain) and teachers from several African countries with a focus on The Gambia and Kenya. The main aim of the project is to promote an understanding of some of the Millennium Development Goals, namely poverty and hunger (MDG 1), environmental sustainability (MDG 7) and the encouragement of a global partnership for development (MDG 8). In relation to the teachers the project organises national CPDs (continuing professional developments) as well as collaborative study visits to the main African partner countries. When conceptualizing these study trips, it was assumed that teachers in a nationally mixed group may help each other to see things from a different perspective. Whether this can be empirically proven is the focus of a research project that is conducted alongside the project. This paper takes a step back and analyses the intercultural communication in the European group before the first study trip took place. It thus not only provides an understanding of the workings of European collaborations, but also some of the necessary background to understand the experiences of the study visit courses.\\n",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Purpose - The creation of sound school-family-community partnerships is being widely acknowledged as it strengthens school programs, family practices, student learning and behavior, as well as development. Active participation of parents and communities in the school tends to reduce the traditional unidirectional accountability of teachers as a sole party responsible for learners' success. Furthermore, such collaboration is said to cultivate new hope about schools and education, especially among rural communities. However, key stakeholders in education claimed that school-family-community partnerships were weak in primary schools in Kakamega County, Kenya (Ministry of Education (MOE), 2010). The paper aims to discuss these issues.\\nDesign/methodology/approach - This study was designed to generate relevant empirical evidence. The study was guided by the Social Capital Theory (Field, 2003; Horvat et al., 2003; Coleman, 1994; Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1992) whose central thesis is that social networks are a valuable asset, as interaction enables people to build communities, commit themselves to each other, and knit the social fabric. Using stratified random sampling, a sample of 361 primary school teachers in 34 schools drawn from a population of 8,964 teachers in 848 primary schools, cutting across the 12 districts in the county, was involved in the study. A questionnaire was developed and used to collect the teachers' views of school-family-community partnership practices in the schools. The data generated were analyzed and presented by means of such descriptive statistics as frequencies, percentages, and the mean.\\nFindings - The findings revealed gaps with respect to collaboration among schools, families, and the community as the key focus in this study. Results indicated that the school-family-community partnerships in the county remained at a transactional rather than a transformational level. In light of the findings, relevant policy recommendations were proposed to improve practice, with particular attention to providing meaningful professional learning as well as desirable student outcomes.\\nOriginality/value - This is one of the largest county-level studies in Kenya directly addressing teacher-family partnerships and illuminating the ways in which schools can build internal capacity for effective family engagement.\\n",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The aim of this research study was to critically appraise the innovation model in relation to teacher development for ICT use in classroom practice associated with the Strengthening Innovative Practice in Secondary Education (SIPSE) project conducted in Kenya secondary schools. The model integrated an ICT Competency Framework for Teachers (ICT-CFT) and a Technology Pedagogy and Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework into a phased modular approach for teacher professional development. The research addressed key questions related to: the object of ICT use as perceived by head teachers and teachers; and the characteristics of teacher design for ICT use in STEM teaching and learning as evidenced in classroom activities at different stages of their professional learning journey. The study used a qualitative design based research (DBR) methodology that was enhanced with the use of a ‘TPACKtivity’ lens combining TPACK and Activity Theory (AT) to explore, explicate and communicate the findings. The study was conducted with a purposive sample of twenty-four teachers, four head teachers and four schools drawn from the wider SIPSE programme intervention. The qualitative research methods included interviews and focus group discussions. Data were also drawn from documentation of lesson plans and peer-to-peer lesson observations. The findings presented participant accounts of tensions and dissonances with the introduction of technology into their school and classroom practices that reflected similar issues in the literature. However, the findings elucidated some unexpected teacher design narratives for technology use to support and innovate STEM teaching and learning. They further revealed the importance of classroom processes as the centre stage for fostering teacher collective design conversations for ICT use solutions. In this the research contributes to the current discourse by offering a TPACKtivity framework centred on authentic classroom settings as a basis for developing and appraising models of professional development for ICT use that can inform practice, policy and research.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "PurposeThe creation of sound school-family-community partnerships is being widely acknowledged as it strengthens school programs, family practices, student learning and behavior, as well as development. Active participation of parents and communities in the school tends to reduce the traditional unidirectional accountability of teachers as a sole party responsible for learners’ success. Furthermore, such collaboration is said to cultivate new hope about schools and education, especially among rural communities. However, key stakeholders in education claimed that school-family-community partnerships were weak in primary schools in Kakamega County, Kenya (Ministry of Education (MOE), 2010). The paper aims to discuss these issues.Design/methodology/approachThis study was designed to generate relevant empirical evidence. The study was guided by the Social Capital Theory (Field, 2003; Horvat et al., 2003; Coleman, 1994; Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1992) whose central thesis is that social networks are a valuable asset, as interaction enables people to build communities, commit themselves to each other, and knit the social fabric. Using stratified random sampling, a sample of 361 primary school teachers in 34 schools drawn from a population of 8,964 teachers in 848 primary schools, cutting across the 12 districts in the county, was involved in the study. A questionnaire was developed and used to collect the teachers’ views of school-family-community partnership practices in the schools. The data generated were analyzed and presented by means of such descriptive statistics as frequencies, percentages, and the mean.FindingsThe findings revealed gaps with respect to collaboration among schools, families, and the community as the key focus in this study. Results indicated that the school-family-community partnerships in the county remained at a transactional rather than a transformational level. In light of the findings, relevant policy recommendations were proposed to improve practice, with particular attention to providing meaningful professional learning as well as desirable student outcomes.Originality/valueThis is one of the largest county-level studies in Kenya directly addressing teacher-family partnerships and illuminating the ways in which schools can build internal capacity for effective family engagement.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Decentralization of teacher recruitment and selection in Kenya was as a result of World Bank/IMF policies, which support projects that guarantee direct net economic returns by productivity and indirect returns on externalities. The approach has been used as a way of improving service delivery. This strategy that has been successful elsewhere may not necessarily be appropriate for Kenya. Any meaningful interventions in Kenya ought to be based on research data from within the countries education system. This paper is based on a research that was conducted in Gucha district in the year 2010. The study sought to assess decentralized approach process and examined the challenges faced in the application of the approach in secondary teacher recruitment and selection. Arising from the descriptive survey research analysis and interpretation is that despite the crucial role decentralized approach play in Secondary teacher recruitment and selection, there are still some negative aspects that hinder the applicability and implementation of the approach. It was noted that, the approach has led to better staffing in rural remote schools, equity and equality in employment leading to community development and high rate of teacher trainee absorption in the employment sector. However, very little attention is paid to competence of the BOG/PTA, adequate funds, corruption, political interference and teacher performance that challenge the efficiency and effectiveness of the approach. Consequently, this paper recommends that capacity building be incorporated to the BOG/PTA members for empowerment; increase of funds set aside by the government for recruitment to increase teacher absorption rate for adequate and equal distribution; streamline decentralized approach to give it a national outlook and supervision of the exercise by professionals for sustainable development in Kenya.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The reality that teachers in developing countries teach large, and even overcrowded classes, is daunting and one that may not go away any time soon. Class size in Kenyan public secondary schools is generally 40-59 students per class. This article reports initial findings on teachers' and principals' perspectives related to large classes. We used questionnaires, interviews and classroom observation data to examine teachers' and principals' perspectives regarding their capacities to teach and manage large classes; what challenges large class sizes present; and what additional supports teachers and principals perceive to be necessary. Both teachers and principals reported that the current class size has a negative impact on teaching and learning. Additionally, both teachers and principals cited a need for more support in the form of (a) professional development; (b) workload reduction; and (c) increased resources. These areas of support could help to mediate the effects of large class size, including an almost sole reliance on lecturing with little teacher-to-student and student-to-student interaction.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "© 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  &  Francis Group. “Young people on the global stage: their education and influence” is an EU-funded project that involves teachers and students from three European countries (Britain, Germany and Spain) and teachers from several African countries with a focus on The Gambia and Kenya. The main aim of the project is to promote an understanding of some of the Millennium Development Goals, namely poverty and hunger (MDG 1), environmental sustainability (MDG 7) and the encouragement of a global partnership for development (MDG 8). In relation to the teachers the project organises national CPDs (continuing professional developments) as well as collaborative study visits to the main African partner countries. When conceptualizing these study trips, it was assumed that teachers in a nationally mixed group may help each other to see things from a different perspective. Whether this can be empirically proven is the focus of a research project that is conducted alongside the project. This paper takes a step back and analyses the intercultural communication in the European group before the first study trip took place. It thus not only provides an understanding of the workings of European collaborations, but also some of the necessary background to understand the experiences of the study visit courses.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Young people on the global stage: their education and influence\" is an EU-funded project that involves teachers and students from three European countries (Britain, Germany and Spain) and teachers from several African countries with a focus on The Gambia and Kenya. The main aim of the project is to promote an understanding of some of the Millennium Development Goals, namely poverty and hunger (MDG 1), environmental sustainability (MDG 7) and the encouragement of a global partnership for development (MDG 8). In relation to the teachers the project organises national CPDs (continuing professional developments) as well as collaborative study visits to the main African partner countries. When conceptualizing these study trips, it was assumed that teachers in a nationally mixed group may help each other to see things from a different perspective. Whether this can be empirically proven is the focus of a research project that is conducted alongside the project. This paper takes a step back and analyses the intercultural communication in the European group before the first study trip took place. It thus not only provides an understanding of the workings of European collaborations, but also some of the necessary background to understand the experiences of the study visit courses.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The aim of this study was to explore the professional development needs of lecturers at Kenyan universities. Specifically, the study investigated the challenges that lecturers and their learners face while in class. It also explored the professional development needs of the lecturers, preferred modes of delivery of the professional development programs and changes that lecturers need to effect in their practice of teaching in order to improve student learning outcomes. The study was guided by two theories: Andragogy and Situated Cognition. The sample size comprised 15 lecturers from one public university in Kenya. Data was collected using the semi-structured interviews. Data was transcribed and analyzed using thematic coding including, four areas of professional development needs: pedagogy, subject matter, technology and research. The study found that in order to enhance student learning outcomes, lecturers need to adopt a more student-centered approach, embrace seminar way of teaching, use practical approaches, be ICT compliant and create and teach courses which offer learners significant learning experiences. The lecturers prefer both face-to-face and online as modes of delivery for professional development programs.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Secondary education provides a vital link between basic education and the world of work, on one hand, and further training on the other. It is therefore an important sub-sector of education in the preparation of human capital for development and provision of life opportunities. Secondary education in Kenya takes four years to complete, catering for students aged 14 to 17 years and it leads to the award of the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education. The objectives of secondary education are to acquire necessary knowledge, skills and attitudes for the development of the self and the nation and to promote love for and loyalty to the nation among others. There are several impediments that have hindered government efforts to provide free day secondary schooling. These include, the New Constitution that made Teachers Service Commission autonomous, unregulated school levies by education officials, heads associations, remedial teaching, and failure by sponsors to play their oversight role and corruption in ministry of education. It is recommended that the students who are not likely to benefit from formal secondary schooling should be provided with options to access secondary education, through alternative methods such as distance learning and skills training. In addition, Kenya Certificate of Primary Education should be scrapped to reduce the demand for boarding schools except among the nomadic communities. With the necessary legislation in place, the government should hire private auditors to ensure prudent use of public resources.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Education for all children is a fundamental right enshrined in national and international regulatory frameworks. Yet, the right to education does not necessarily imply inclusion. According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF, 2014), a large segment of children are not in school and have long remained invisible, hidden, and forgotten: children with disabilities. The study aimed to identify key challenges and implementation gaps related to inclusive education in Kenya and Tanzania, and to delineate the extent to which these are being addressed through current and/or planned interventions. The study sample comprised 301 respondents (272 teachers, 24 head teachers, and 4 education officers) from the coastal region of Kenya and Tanzania in eastern Africa. Analyses from government policies, status reports, strategies and plans on inclusive education were incorporated to facilitate discussion. The study found that there was an overwhelming challenge of identifying and documenting disability trends in schools. A second challenge was in provision of training to both professionals and paraprofessionals in Tanzania and Kenya. The study recommends that development partners should first commission a study to determine the true demographics of disability in Tanzania and Kenya, in cooperation with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), universities, and advocacy groups, and then synergize resources and expertise to ensure true implementation of inclusion in accordance with the tenets of the Community Based Rehabilitation model (CBR).",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The literature is unequivocal about the importance of improving academic engagement in addressing challenges such as school drop out or increasing student motivation. What is less certain, particularly in the literature from developing countries, is how social support systems (parents, teachers, and classmates) influence students' emotional and behavioral engagement. Drawing from the ecological perspective, this study analyzes data from Ghana using structural equation modeling to examine mediated and unmediated pathways through which parent, teacher, and classmate support affect students' emotional and behavioral engagement. Findings suggest classmate support has the strongest association with student engagement, followed by parental support. Teacher support is neither a mediator nor a direct predictor of student engagement. These findings have implications for teacher training and professional development, especially training on how to actively involve parents in motivating their children to be engaged scholars.\\n",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Definitions of quality in early childhood education (ECE) has predominantly adopted a developmental perspective, where quality care is that which promotes optimal child outcomes in all domains of development. This study investigates Developmentally Appropriate Practice (DAP), an approach designed to promote young children's optimal learning and development in four (4) early childhood centers in Accra, Ghana. A sample of parents and teachers (154 respondents comprising (100) parents (males - 44%; females - 56%), fifty (50) teachers (males - 20%; females - 80%) analyzed indicated that both parents and teachers had only fair knowledge on quality and DAP recommendations in early childhood settings, and this knowledge was associated with high income, higher education and fewer children in the family for parents but not teachers. Parents cited trained staff as a more essential quality indicator than teachers did. There was no statistically significant difference between the level of knowledge of developmentally appropriate practices between parents and teachers and between trained and untrained teachers. Recommendations offered include monitoring by the Ministry of Education to ensure professional training of teachers in childcare settings and also in dissemination of research-based findings to practitioners/professionals in the childcare settings to update their knowledge and skills.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This book responds to growing recognition by international education professionals, policy makers, and funding partners of the need for qualified teachers and interest in the subject of teacher professional development (also referred to as \"teacher behavior change\"). The book responds to important questions that are fundamental to improving teaching quality by influencing teaching practice. These questions include: How do we provide high-quality training at scale? How do we ensure that training transfers to change in practice? What methods are most cost-effective? How do we know what works? The book includes case studies describing different approaches to teacher behavior change and illustrates how specific implementation choices were made for each context. Individual chapters document lessons learned as well as methodologies used for discerning lessons. The key conclusion is that no single effort is enough on its own; teacher behavior change requires a system-wide view and concerted, coordinated inputs from a range of stakeholders. This book contains the following chapters: (1) Understanding and Influencing Teacher Behavior Change: Editorial Introduction (Sarah Pouezevara); (2) Changing Teacher Educators' Conceptions and Practices Around Literacy Instruction: Lessons from Teacher Educators' Professional Development Experiences in Ethiopia (Dawit Mekonnen, Marion Fesmire, Adrienne Barnes, Stephen Backman, and Flavia Ramos-Mattoussi); (3) School Leadership and Early Grade Reading: Examining the Evidence in Zambia (Mitchell Rakusin and Guy Bostock); (4) Making Sense of Teacher In-Service Training in the Philippines (Nancy Clark-Chiarelli and Bonita Cabiles); (5) Short Message Service (SMS)-Based Remote Support and Teacher Retention of Training Gains in Malawi (Timothy S. Slade, Scott Kipp, Stirling Cummings, and Kondwani Nyirongo); (6) Relationships Between Coach Support and Teachers' Adoption of New Instructional Practices: Findings from the Nigeria Reading and Access Research Activity (RARA) (Karon Harden, Alison Pflepsen, and Simon King); (7) Using Activity Theory to Understand Teacher Peer Learning in Indonesia (Sarah Pouezevara, Feiny Sentosa, and Tifa Asrianti); (8) Teacher Motivation and Behavior Change: Results of the Teacher Motivation Diagnostic Tool in Northern India (Molly Hamm-Rodríguez, Emily Richardson, and Jarret Guajardo); and (9) Once More Up the Mountain: The Promise of High-Quality Teaching Depends on Behavior Change (Lee E. Nordstrum). Contains a section about the contributors and an index. (Individual chapters contain references.) [Erin Newton compiled this volume.]",

    "Abstract (AB)": "© Common Ground Research Networks, Lirije Olluri, Sejdi Sejdiu. This study examined the play beliefs of basic school teachers in Ghana. Participants were a purposive sample of 571 basic school teachers from three regions of Ghana. The Play Beliefs Inventory (PBI) served as the data source. The PBI included forty items designed to assess teachers' play beliefs within two subscales: Play Focus (PF) and Traditional African Play (TAP). Teachers responded to a five-point Likert scale ranging from strongly agree (scored 5) to strongly disagree (scored 1). A higher score indicated a stronger play belief and a lower score a weaker play belief. The PBI had a Cronbach's alpha of.833. Data across the entire sample indicated that most of the teachers reported strong play beliefs. Experienced teachers were more likely to report lower play beliefs. Play beliefs of males and females were similar. Two-Way Analyses of Variance indicated that region, professional qualification, and certification had significant effects for PF, TAP, and PBI-grade level was not significant. The number of girls in class was significant, while the overall class size was not. However, region showed significant interactions with grade level and certification, but not with professional qualification. Teachers with post-secondary certificates had lower play beliefs than untrained teachers, those with diplomas or bachelor's degrees. Teachers with early childhood certification had higher play beliefs than those with general basic education certification. These findings indicate that region, professional qualification, certification, and the number of girls in class were significant factors that should be considered in attempts to raise the status of play in the development and learning among young children.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "© 2018, © 2018 British Association for International and Comparative Education. This article explores and compares the way in which Danish and Kenyan student-teachers achieve a professional identity while training to be teachers, drawing on conceptually-related theoretical approaches of critical psychology, social theory of learning, professional literature and literature about narratives and life history. Findings from contextual comparisons of the students’ life stories suggest that the process of professional becoming may be viewed as a highly personal meaning-making and storied process following individual trajectories through teacher training; yet moments in which students change professional identification are often ingrained in social relations with tutors and other students, or take place during periods of teaching practice. Student-teachers come to acknowledge teacher training as a resource and part of a personal life project, and some students change their professional identification profoundly during teacher training.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This dissertation examines the development of professional identity among faculty members at Zambia's flagship university, the University of Zambia (UNZA), at several epochs in the institution's history. The study explores how faculty identities emerged, shifted and were reconfigured in response to the shifts in the political economic landscape of the country. These shifts included the movement from a strong socialist orientation in the post-independence era (1964-1991) to a neoliberal system from 1991 to the 2016. The research data was collected through close to eight months of fieldwork at the Great East Road campus of UNZA between May 2016 and January 2017. The primary instrument of data collection was a semi-structured interview I conducted with 30 academics, representing three generations of faculty at UNZA, the first generation from 1966 to 1990, the second generation from 1991 to 200, and the third generation from 2000 to the present. The findings of the study suggest that there are several identities that have emerged over the past five decades of UNZA's history dependent on the subject positions availed by the political economy of higher education. In the early years, marked by an abundance of funding from the federal government, the faculty tended to occupy subject positions connected to the discourse of national building and the liberation of Southern Africa. This led to the emergence of nation-builder academics and liberation-scholar academic. With the overhaul of the socialist system in 1991, new subject positions opened in the 1990s as entrepreneurial motivations started to drive academic work. In this age, the scientrepreneur academics came to the fore and prided themselves for being hunter-scholars. With the further entrenchment of neoliberal discourses and practices of accountability, efficiency and competitiveness after 2000, the development of scholarly identity became a struggle to become academically alive, in an ontological sense, marked by the importance of being mentioned by other scholars, leaders in the university, as well as multilateral and bilateral donor agencies. This study concludes that there is a need for the development of policies that reduce excessive teaching and community service demands on faculty, particularly early-career faculty, and reduce the number of challenges the faculty face in negotiating their professional identities.

    "Abstract (AB)": "© 2018 PEC.  One of the major challenges of the 21 st century is the increasing level of academic qualifications at the expense of relevance in education. School agriculture is one of the subjects which require teachers who as the principal implementers of the curriculum must be able to interpret agriculture curriculum objectives to meet societal needs. However, implementation of agriculture curriculum in Arid and Semi Arid Land (ASAL) secondary schools has fallen short of its expectations as it has not significantly influenced agricultural activities both in school and surrounding communities. Thus, the benefit of implementing agriculture curriculum in ASALs is yet to be fully achieved. The research sought to document the teacher factors influencing implementation of secondary school agriculture curriculum in ASAL schools in Kenya. The research focused on teacher training, teacher technical knowledge and skills about Dry Land Agriculture [DLA] practices and training and support. The research was carried out in ASAL counties of Baringo, Makueni and Narok. Survey research design was used. The researcher developed a semi-structured questionnaire to obtain data on the teacher factors from 88 agriculture teachers. The research results showed that most teachers were trained and professionally qualified thus expected to translate the curriculum objectives to learning activities relevant to ASALS. However, agriculture teachers were found to be deficient in terms of technical knowhow on DLA practices among them, insitu water harvesting and use of sunken beds. Agriculture teachers received insufficient support towards professional development. The support did not aim at DLA knowledge and skill enhancement towards agriculture curriculum implementation. Agriculture teachers' inadequacy on DLA practices' technical knowhow and lack of support towards professional development was impacting negatively on agriculture curriculum implementation in ASAL schools. The Government has a responsibility of ensuring that all ASAL schools are staffed with qualified teacher. Secondary school administrations in ASALs need to support teachers on continuous trainings that are relevant to agriculture curriculum implementation. Agriculture training program developers need to focus more on the acquisition of technical know on all DLA practices. Addressing the training inadequacies among agriculture teachers in ASAL schools will lead to a competent staff who can translate curriculum objectives into learning experiences that promote DLA in ASALs. This translation will in turn influence agricultural activities both in school and in the society for improved agricultural production.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Teachers are expected to facilitate learning for children and youth, attend to their students’ diverse academic needs, and provide emotional support and encouragement, while simultaneously meeting the expectations and demands of students, families, colleagues, school leaders and the larger education system. In crisis-affected and displacement contexts, teachers are regularly expected to perform these duties with little to no training, support or materials (Burns & Lawrie, 2015). Jackie Kirk, along with her colleague, Rebecca Winthrop, captured the inherent tension of this situation and the uncertain sense of identity that teachers in these contexts experience. Kirk and Winthrop (2007, p. 719) proposed the ideas of “spontaneous teachers,” who become teachers reluctantly given the circumstances, and “tentative teachers,” who feel uncertain about serving as teachers or remaining in the profession. Their conceptualization of teacher identity rings true for the teachers that my graduate students and I have been working within Kakuma refugee camp in northwestern Kenya since 2013. A similar sentiment is captured in the following quote from a young refugee teacher in the camp from South Sudan:&#xa0;\"Yes, I’m happy to be a teacher, but with a condition. If I can get training and prove that I’m a teacher, that’s when I will tell that I’m happy to be a teacher. But as per now, I have not yet known the sweetness of being a teacher because I have not been trained…. As per now, I don't call myself a good teacher. I am not good because I am not a professional. (Male teacher, South Sudan, July 2015)\". Inspired by Kirk and Winthrop’s work on teacher identity in crisis contexts, and with hopes of raising the profile of these teachers, my students and I have been engaged in an intertwined research-practice approach that aims to better support teacher professional development in refugee settings, while simultaneously creating opportunities for teachers in the camp to comment, critique, shape and continually refine our collaborative approach to supporting their needs. As we continue to advocate for the right to education for all children around the world, including the 75 million out of school due to conflict and crisis (Nicolai et al., 2016), we must simultaneously take more concerted action in the name of social justice to support the teachers working in these contexts. This dispatch will share and reflect on our efforts to collaborate with teachers in Kakuma over the years and how we continue to do so through the more recent creation of our “Teachers for Teachers” initiative.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The Ghanaian mathematics curriculum expects teachers to adopt technologies as an instructional tool to assist students to learn mathematics relationally. Teachers' dispositions (knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes) towards technology are critical in translating the curriculum intention into practice. This paper presents teachers' initial dispositions related to technology integration and their views about a professional development model. In this model, they worked in teams to develop and enact GeoGebra-based mathematics lessons with support from expert, exemplary materials, and demonstration lessons. The results indicate that the model of professional development is promising in engaging teachers in technology integration.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This report captures what might be learnt from a selection of the world's most interesting examples of technology-assisted in-service professional development in lower-income countries and from wider reflections about the potential of technology to enhance the professional learning of teachers. This report explores the literature surrounding technology for professional learning, identifying six promising case studies: (1) UNESCO projects in Pakistan and Nigeria -- using mobile phones to deliver pedagogical content to early-grade and primary school teachers; (2) English in Action, Bangladesh using mobile phones and SD cards to deliver content to teachers; (3) Teacher Education in Sub-Saharan Africa (TESSA) -- OER [Open Educational Resources] to support interactive teaching practice; (4) Teacher Education through School-based Support in India (TESS-India) -- OER to support the adoption of more engaging pedagogies; (5) Teachers for Teachers, Kenya -- using mobile technology to strengthen teacher development in Kakuma Refugee Camp; and (6) National Tablets Programme, Kenya -- improving the coaching provided to teachers. Through these case studies we have made a series of reflections on the impact technology can have on teacher professional development, particularly in low- and low-middle income contexts: (1) Promising technology is not enough, we must not forget the human factor; (2) Mobile technologies have high potential to improve the reach, scalability and flexibility of teacher professional development; (3) OER constitute a promising format for professional development resources; (4) High-impact, sustainable technology-enabled solutions depend on local partnership and a sense of local ownership; and (5) The design and delivery of effective technology-enabled professional learning depends on high-quality impact data and careful piloting solutions. Our report explores each of these case studies and reflections in greater detail, drawing lessons for policymakers, practitioners and other organisations who seek to provide technology-related professional development opportunities for teachers.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This qualitative case study examined the cultural learning insights of four educators during and after an immersion experience in Kenya. During this experience the participants delivered professional development sessions to teachers in two rural Kenyan schools, and stayed with Kenyan families. Mezirow's transformational learning theory, self-reflection, and cultural humility were utilized as a framework to examine the educators' learning experiences. Data were collected through pre-trip planning sessions, journals, debriefing sessions, field notes, and a 6-month follow-up interview. Results of the data produced five main themes: (1) general observations; (2) recognizing biases and assumptions; (3) cultural insights; (4) cultural humility; and (5) spiritual insights. Even though these participants had prior interactions with different cultures, this trip expanded their experiences and provided them with further understanding of how to interact with different cultures abroad, and within their professional contexts. While cultural aspects tend to be emphasized in undergraduate programs, these experienced educators benefitted from this cultural immersion experience, which could be used to make a case for continuing the same emphasis in graduate programs.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Students should begin to engage in problem-solving and higher order thinking skills in mathematics in the early years of school in preparation for 21st-century technology and problem-solving competencies. Using the Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ), this study examines the distribution of significant teacher quality factors related to sixth-grade students’ mathematics competencies across the regions of Kenya and Zimbabwe. The mathematics competencies range from Pre-numeracy to Abstract Problem Solving level. First, we use a multi-level regression model to analyze the relationships between teacher quality and students’ mathematics competencies to find out which teacher quality variables are important for the improvement in students’ mathematics competencies in the participating countries. We then illustrate the distributions of the teacher quality factors within the regions in Kenya and Zimbabwe. From the multilevel model analysis, the teacher quality factors related to students’ increase in mathematics competencies were teaching experience, mathematics competencies, and teachers’ academic qualifications. We observe that students taught by permanently employed teachers had lower math competencies and that the days spent by the teachers in professional development influence students’ mathematics competencies negatively. The distributions of these teacher quality factors that matter in sub-Sahara Africa are concentrated in the capital cities and particular regions in Kenya and Zimbabwe. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "© 2018 The authors and IJLTER.ORG. Work-based learning (WBL) is a transition from educational institutions that creates an integrated experience for teacher trainees to put theory into practice. On the same vein, teaching practice is a training exercise enabling teacher trainees' opportunities for acquiring practical skills vital for professional development. Success during teaching practice is the teacher trainees' procedural knowledge and preparedness in teaching subjects, content awareness and instructional methods. Adequate preparedness creates an environment that alleviates fears, allows development of skills and decision making abilities prior to teaching practice. The study explored procedural knowledge on teacher preparedness for teaching practice using work-based learning at the University of Nairobi. The population consisted of 68 teacher trainees undertaking teaching practice. Descriptive survey design was adopted and data collected through a questionnaire. Findings showed that teacher trainees were adequately prepared for teaching practice. The study recommends adoption of work-based learning in preparing teacher trainees for effective professional competence.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "© 2018 The Author(s) Several rigorously evaluated programs have recently shown positive effects on early literacy and numeracy outcomes in developing countries. However, these programs have not been designed to evaluate which ingredients of the interventions are most essential to improve literacy outcomes. Policy makers therefore lack evidence as to whether program ingredients such as teacher professional development (PD), instructional coaching, learner materials, teachers’ guides, community support, or technology are required for program impact. The Kenya Primary Math and Reading Initiative was a randomized controlled trial that compared three treatment groups with specific ingredients and a control group. Using literacy and numeracy outcome measures for grades 1 and 2, we evaluated the benefits of the following ingredients: (1) teacher PD and teacher instructional support and coaching; (2) revised student books in literacy and numeracy, at a 1:1 ratio, added to PD and instructional support; and (3) structured teacher lesson plans added to student books, PD, and instructional support. We found that two of the three combinations of ingredients had statistically significant positive impacts on learning outcomes. The results showed that the third combination—PD, teacher instructional support and coaching, 1:1 student books, and structured teacher lesson plans—was most effective. A cost-effectiveness analysis on the ingredients showed that the option of PD and instructional support, 1:1 revised books, and teachers’ guides was the most expensive, but that the additional impact on learning made this the most cost-effective intervention. This study rigorously analyzes which ingredients for literacy and numeracy improvement would be most effective for overall impact, and suggests to policy makers that careful decisions regarding program ingredients will lead to more effectively designed and implemented interventions to improve learning in developing countries.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "© 2018, © Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to find out the similarities and differences in collection management practices of the main libraries of the University of Cape Coast and the University of Education, Winneba, Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a qualitative approach in considering the research problem and also used the case study to collect data. Purposive sampling technique was used to select the respondents. Findings: Some of the results highlighted are: both libraries had sections responsible for collection management practices, the collection management practices carried out by both libraries were almost similar, lack of adequate professional staff, lack of adequate funds and unavailability of Collection Management Policy were some of the challenges. Research limitations/implications: The study focussed on the activities performed by the various sections directly involved in the collection management practices and excludes administrative practices. Practical implications: In order to make any library functional, collection management should be a shared responsibility of all the sections of the library and that enough money is required to link the staff and the information resources in the library together. Social implications: All stakeholders of libraries must play their role to make academic libraries functional. Originality/value: The study provides insight into the collection development activities undertaken by the libraries of the only public academic institutions purposely build by the Government of Ghana to train graduate teachers for Basic and Second-Cycle institutions in Ghana.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Low- and middle-income countries have made significant progress getting children into school, but student learning and achievement are often dreadfully low (Berry, Barnett, & Hinton, 2015; Pritchett, 2013). Approximately 250 million children across the world are not acquiring basic reading and math skills, even though about half have spent at least 4 years in school (United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation, 2014). Zambia faces many common educational challenges. Literacy rates among young Zambian adults ages 15--24 are 58.5% for females and 70.3% for males, despite an average of 7.7 years and 7.9 years of education, respectively (Zambia Demographic and Health Surveys, 2013--14; UNICEF, 2015). Community schools in Zambia are in need of a cost-effective solution for delivering quality education in order to improve learning outcomes. The Impact Network program represents a promising approach to improving educational outcomes by incorporating three potentially high-impact components that could create important synergies: e-learning, ongoing teacher training and professional development, and community ownership. The American Institutes for Research (AIR) has designed and is implementing a mixed-methods cluster-randomized controlled trial (cluster-RCT) to determine the impact of Impact Network's eSchool 360 model. The study comprises three main evaluation components: an impact evaluation of the eSchool 360 model, an analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the eSchool 360 model, and a process evaluation of the expansion of the eSchool 360 model. To determine the impact of the program, we are using a cluster-RCT in which 64 eligible schools have been randomly assigned either to receive Impact Network's eSchool 360 program (30 treatment schools) or not to receive the program (34 control schools). This report presents the baseline results of the cluster-RCT used to determine the impact of Impact Network's eSchool 360 model. It examines the differences between the treatment and control households along the causal chain of the theory of change. In addition, it analyzes the potential for floor effects on the assessment instruments that will be used to measure the impact of the Impact Network program on student outcomes 1 year and 3 years after the introduction of the Impact Network eSchool 360 model. The baseline findings in this report suggest that the cluster-RCT was successful in creating equivalence in observable characteristics between treatment and control households.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to find out the similarities and differences in collection management practices of the main libraries of the University of Cape Coast and the University of Education, Winneba, Ghana.Design/methodology/approachThe study adopted a qualitative approach in considering the research problem and also used the case study to collect data. Purposive sampling technique was used to select the respondents.FindingsSome of the results highlighted are: both libraries had sections responsible for collection management practices, the collection management practices carried out by both libraries were almost similar, lack of adequate professional staff, lack of adequate funds and unavailability of Collection Management Policy were some of the challenges.Research limitations/implicationsThe study focussed on the activities performed by the various sections directly involved in the collection management practices and excludes administrative practices.Practical implicationsIn order to make any library functional, collection management should be a shared responsibility of all the sections of the library and that enough money is required to link the staff and the information resources in the library together.Social implicationsAll stakeholders of libraries must play their role to make academic libraries functional.Originality/valueThe study provides insight into the collection development activities undertaken by the libraries of the only public academic institutions purposely build by the Government of Ghana to train graduate teachers for Basic and Second-Cycle institutions in Ghana.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The importance of mother tongue-based bilingual medium of instruction in bilingual and multilingual classrooms has been evidenced in ample studies in different parts of the world including Ghana. However, studies on how bilingualism is carried out with respect to classroom displays in bilingual education is very scant and even none, as far as I know, in Ghana. Also, there is emerging research on teachers’ translanguaging practices in other parts of the world including South Africa but research on instructional use of translanguaging is yet to be conducted in Ghana. Therefore, this study examined kindergarten teachers’ bilingual practices with regard to classroom displays as well as their translanguaging practices at morning assembly in some selected schools in the Cape Coast Metropolis in the Central Region of Ghana.   The study used the Ghanaian part of a secondary data that was sponsored by the New Civics Grants from the Spencer Foundation in the USA. Joint research team from the USA and Ghana collected these data in six kindergarten classrooms in each of the two countries. Even though the initial purpose of the study was to examine how classroom wall displays connected with young children's roles as apprentice citizens, repurposing it for this study was suitable because all the classrooms photographed are public schools that use the NALAP in their ECE classrooms. However, four schools participated because they used the local languages that I can read and write.   Guided by the purpose, two research questions and two different data (photographs of classroom wall displays and video of morning assembly) were used. I used qualitative design through visual research method and Barbara Rogoff’s (1990, 2003) socio-cultural theory as my theoretical lens. The photo data was analyzed semiotically (Chandler, 2007, Semetsky, 2010, 2017) and used discourse analysis with the big “D” for the analysis of the video data (Gee, 2014, Gee & Handford, 2012).   The findings indicated that all the schools except one had bilingually labeled displays among their classroom displays (though bilingual labeling was given less attention) with the major language pair for the bilingual labeling being English and Mfantse languages. It also came out that most of the bilingually labeled displays were posted within the eye level of the students. More so, with regard to the sign type, most of the bilingually labeled displays were iconic. Regarding the teachers’ translanguaging practices at morning assembly, the findings indicated that all the participating schools and teachers translanguaged during the conduct of their respective morning assembly. It was revealed that aside from using translanguaging as comprehension enhancer, it was also used as a downtoner as well as alienation tool linguistically. However, the findings showed that English only displays far dominated both the bilingual labeling and translanguaging practices of the teachers.   Based on the findings, the study recommended that ECE colleges of education in Ghana should include knowledge and skills for bilingual labeling in their pre-service preparation since the nation is a multilingual state. Also, pedagogical use of translanguaging should be included in teacher education curriculum so that teachers would be intentional about its usage in instruction delivery. In addition, higher education like University of Cape Coast (UCC) and University of Education, Winneba (UEW) which are the main trainers of teacher educators in the country need to develop curriculum for bilingual teaching with attention to effective design and use of bilingual labeling and training manuals for ECE teachers on the effective use of bilingual labeling and pedagogical use of translanguaging in Ghanaian ECE education. More so, there should professional development on the effective use of bilingual classroom display as well as translanguaging for in-service teachers in Ghana so to promote the academic achievement of the bi/multilingual students Ghanaian schools serve.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "© 2018, © 2018 Australian Teacher Education Association. Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for teachers in Kenya suffers from challenges such as inadequate resources, poor planning, competing interests, among others. Besides being traditional in approach, most CPD sessions are far between to be meaningfully helpful. With increasing uptake of technology and number of social media users in Kenya, Facebook can be a potential platform to enhance teachers’ professional development. This exploratory cross-sectional survey focussed on discussions teachers had in the month of February 2015 on one Facebook Group named ‘Teachers of English’. A directed content analysis of the 647 posts following Shulman’s category of teacher knowledge base revealed that interactions on the group centred on the teaching of English and Literature, as well as on other education-related matters. This study concludes that that Facebook Groups can be fertile avenues for teachers’ ongoing professional development, especially in developing countries where such opportunities are scarce.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Experiential learning requires teacher educators to equip trainee teachers with opportunities for effective preparedness in teaching and professional subjects, co-curricular activities and in micro-teaching vital for professional development. The experiential learning opportunities, conditional knowledge, preparedness and performance during teaching practice provide basis for predicting professional competence and success for effective teaching. Conditional knowledge entails application of critical thinking and problem solving skills that demonstrate mastery of theoretical knowledge and professional practice across, content, knowledge, skills and insights. This type of knowledge and skills are developed through experiential learning coupled with effective preparedness for real-class instructional management. However, inadequate preparation in educational courses coupled with improper supervision and feedback impede effective professional development in most universities. The study explored effectiveness of experiential learning and conditional knowledge in trainee teacher preparedness for teaching practice at the University of Nairobi. Experiential Learning Theory formed the framework for this study. A descriptive survey research design was adopted with a population of 78 trainee teachers selected using simple random sampling. Data were gathered through a questionnaire. Finding showed that trainee teachers are adequately prepared for teaching practice. The study recommends proper orientation for trainee teachers to be carried out with effective preparedness that aligns theory to practice.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Access to quality education largely depends on the extent of English language usage. Despite the use of English language as the medium of instruction in Ghana, the performance of students in the West African Senior High School Examination is still worrying. The study is designed to examine the influence of mother tongue on Students’ performance in English language in Adu Gyamfi Senior High School. The study investigated if mother tongue is exclusively the cause of the students’ abysmal performance in English Language in Senior High School Certificate Examination and to explore if there are other intervening factors. Fifteen (15) respondents (constituting five males and five females) with a focus group involving five students who are graduates of the West African Senior High School Certificate from Adu Gyamfi Senior High in School in Ghana were used. All the respondents had low grades in the certificate examination. The study employed exploratory case study using thematic analysis with semi-structured open-ended questionnaires. The results revealed that even though mother tongue interference is the core factor of the students’ poor performance in English language in the West African Senior High School Certificate examination, there are other factors contributing to students’ poor performance in English language. These factors include poor teaching methods, lack of textbooks, language background and lack of professional growth and development of teachers. Suggested measures that could enhance students’ achievement in English language are given.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Every year, billions of dollars are spent on development aid and training around the world. However, only 10% of this training results in the transfer of knowledge, skills, or behaviors learned in the training to the work place. Ideally, learning transfer produces effective and continued application by learners of the knowledge and skills they gained through their learning activities. Currently, there is a limited body of research examining the factors that hinder and promote learning transfer in professional development, particularly the professional development of school leaders in developing countries. This qualitative exploratory study sought to address the gap in the literature by examining six schools: three in Burkina Faso and three in Ghana, West Africa. This investigation explored what promoted and hindered learning transfer in both countries. The sample consisted of 13 West-African school leaders (6 in Burkina Faso and 7 in Ghana) who attended a 3-day leadership training workshop. Data collection included in-depth interviews, document analysis, post-training site visits, and text messages to ascertain whether this mobile technology intervention enhanced learning transfer. The findings demonstrated that learning transfer occurred in both countries in all six schools. Data indicated that most of the transfer of learning happened in areas not requiring mindset and behavioral changes. Data suggested that the facilities in which the trainings took place, the facilitators’ dispositions and knowledge, the adequacy of the materials as well as the testimonials and certificate of completions enhanced the transfer of learning. Participants also indicated some inhibitors to the transfer of learning, such as financial, cultural, and human behavior constraints. This study helps increase our understanding of what promotes and inhibits learning transfer in educational settings in Burkina Faso and Ghana and provides suggestions for trainers and teachers who facilitate trainings.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The study explored the head teachers' professional needs in school management. The qualitative study was underpinned by the interpretive philosophical thought. It employed a case study approach and collected data using interview guide. Purposive sampling technique was employed to select 15 head teachers and 6 circuit supervisors to participate in the exercise. The study revealed that the head teachers were not unaware of the managerial skills they needed to proficiently manage their schools. However, the participants seemed to have a need in executing staff personnel services, financial and business management and school community relationship roles. The participants also had concerns with respect to lack of pre-headship training, lack of needs assessment prior to in-service training programmes, inadequate continuous professional development programmes and lack of authority to sanction staff. The head teachers and circuit supervisors, therefore, unanimously called for pre-headship and in-service training programmes respectively for aspiring and serving head teachers to equip them with the requisite competencies for headship duties. The participants believed that continuous professional development programmes have the capacity to update and upgrade head teachers' knowledge and skills to enhance their professional growth and development.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Several rigorously evaluated programs have recently shown positive effects on early literacy and numeracy outcomes in developing countries. However, these programs have not been designed to evaluate which ingredients of the interventions are most essential to improve literacy outcomes. Policy makers therefore lack evidence as to whether program ingredients such as teacher professional development (PD), instructional coaching, learner materials, teachers’ guides, community support, or technology are required for program impact. The Kenya Primary Math and Reading Initiative was a randomized controlled trial that compared three treatment groups with specific ingredients and a control group. Using literacy and numeracy outcome measures for grades 1 and 2, we evaluated the benefits of the following ingredients: (1) teacher PD and teacher instructional support and coaching; (2) revised student books in literacy and numeracy, at a 1:1 ratio, added to PD and instructional support; and (3) structured teacher lesson plans added to student books, PD, and instructional support. We found that two of the three combinations of ingredients had statistically significant positive impacts on learning outcomes. The results showed that the third combination-PD, teacher instructional support and coaching, 1:1 student books, and structured teacher lesson plans-was most effective. A cost-effectiveness analysis on the ingredients showed that the option of PD and instructional support, 1:1 revised books, and teachers’ guides was the most expensive, but that the additional impact on learning made this the most cost-effective intervention. This study rigorously analyzes which ingredients for literacy and numeracy improvement would be most effective for overall impact, and suggests to policy makers that careful decisions regarding program ingredients will lead to more effectively designed and implemented interventions to improve learning in developing countries.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "© 2018 The authors and IJLTER.ORG. Preparation and management of teaching practice allows for adequate allocation of resources and effective utilization of instructional strategies that permit teacher trainees to adjust to varying situational demands of learning tasks. Teacher trainees with adequate preparation to work facilitate learning process and guide learners in discerning appropriate application of knowledge, skills and attitudes for professional competency. In addition, effective teaching practice begins with authentic preparation through; identifying teaching practice school, attending to briefing prior to posting for teaching practice, gathering teaching practice preparation materials, preparing teaching learning resources and identifying appropriate assessment methods. However, proficiency in preparation and management of teaching practice are among weak areas of professional development in universities in Kenya. If combined with failure in identifying appropriate teaching practice schools, inadequate resources and inefficient class management skills, teaching practice may result in detrimental instructional organization with little concern over learners' needs. This study determined preparation and management of teaching practice process at the University of Nairobi. Anchored on descriptive survey design, the study targeted 68 trainee teachers on teaching practice from 17 Counties sampled randomly. The study used questionnaires and interview schedules to collect data from trainee teachers. For data analysis, the study relied on descriptive and inferential statistics, with data presented using tables and graphs. The results indicated that teacher trainees are adequately prepared for teaching practice. Recommendations advocate for teacher educators to examine relevant preparation strategies and adjustment to ensure that teaching practice is appropriately managed to achieve professional development. Further, Universities and government should create suitable, dependable, diversified and sustainable mechanisms for financing teaching practice exercise.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Previous studies showed a lack of empirical data regarding the use of digital technology in teaching mathematics in secondary schools in Kenya. This scarcity of data prompted the need to conduct studies about teachers’ perceptions on the use of digital tools in Migori County, Kenya. The purpose of this study was to investigate what perceptions Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) mathematics teachers have about the use of digital tools in education service delivery. This mixed-methods study used an adapted Moyer’s (2011) Constructivist Theory model to examine the use of digital technology in grade 12 mathematics classrooms in 93 public secondary schools in Migori County, Kenya. The researcher developed a 15-item survey to gather data from 223 teachers during phase-I. Phase-II consisted of in-person and open-ended interviews conducted with eight teachers. Eight to 12 questions were employed in the interview instrument depending on the sensitivity of data.    Conclusions of this study recommended more training be given to teachers and professionals in the use of digital tools, and that future researchers investigate the impact of teachers’ technology professional development events on use of technology. Additionally, specific research focus ought to be based on the differences between male and female teachers when large female teacher samples are employed. Further, suggestions were made to conduct future research on any differences that would emerge when additional technology tools are availed and utilized in classrooms.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "In recent years, there has been an increase in the demand for and supply of early childhood education (ECE) in low- and middle-income countries. There is also growing awareness that unless ECE is of high quality, children may attend school but not learn. There is a large literature on the conceptualization and measurement of ECE quality in the United States that focuses on the nature of teacher-child interactions. Efforts to expand access to high quality ECE in low- and middle-income countries will require similar measurement efforts that are theoretically-grounded and culturally-adapted. This paper assesses the factor structure and concurrent validity of an observational classroom quality tool to assess teacher-child interactions-the Teacher Instructional Practices and Processes System (TIPPS; Seidman et al., 2013)-in Ghanaian pre-primary classrooms. We find evidence of three conceptually distinct but empirically correlated domains of quality: Facilitating Deeper Learning (FDL), Supporting Student Expression (SSE), and Emotional Support and Behavior Management (ESBM). Teachers' schooling level, training in early childhood development, and professional well-being positively predict the three quality domains in different ways. SSE and ESBM predict classroom end-of-the-school-year academic outcomes, and SSE predicts classroom end-of-the-school-year social-emotional outcomes. Implications for the field of international education and global ECE policy and research are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\\n",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Early childhood development and education (ECDE) is devolved in Kenya, which means that each of Kenya's 47 counties budgets for and implements ECDE independently. Kenya provides two years of preprimary education to children ages four and five. Given scarce resources, constructing facilities and hiring teachers are often principal considerations for county governments. The present study investigated whether and how counties go beyond the basic provision of facilities and teachers to invest in learning materials, expand teacher professional development, and hire coaches to improve the quality of teaching. These results are presented in the context of the Tayari ECDE program, which was designed to improve school readiness in a cost-effective way. We present qualitative findings from several counties to describe how government bodies invest in additional elements of preprimary quality improvement. We also compare results across counties that do and do not implement the Tayari model to understand whether implementation of an effective program to increase ECDE quality encourages adjustments in government resource allocations. In addition, we present quantitative results from a large-scale longitudinal treatment and control study of the Tayari model, which tested the effectiveness of curriculum-aligned instructional materials and teacher training and support in improving learners' school readiness in public and low-cost private learning centers. Finally, we present policy implications for decentralized government structures responsible for providing ECDE, noting how these can be supported and incentivized to increase investments in ECDE quality.",

We assessed the impacts of a teacher professional development program for public and private kindergartens in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana. We examined impacts on teacher professional well-being, classroom quality, and children’s readiness during one school year. This cluster-randomized trial included 240 schools (teachers N = 444; children N = 3,345, M age = 5.2) randomly assigned to one of three conditions: teacher training (TT), teacher training plus parental-awareness meetings (TTPA), and controls. The programs incorporated workshops and in-classroom coaching for teachers and video-based discussion groups for parents. Moderate impacts were found on some dimensions of professional well-being (reduced burnout in the TT and TTPA conditions, reduced turnover in the TT condition), classroom quality (increased emotional support/behavior management in the TT and TTPA conditions, support for student expression in the TT condition), and small impacts on multiple domains of children’s school readiness (in the TT condition). The parental-awareness meetings had counteracting effects on child school readiness outcomes. Implications for policy and practice are discussed for Ghana and for early childhood education in low- and middle-income countries.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "It has been argued that to be able to practice in a culturally sensitive manner, social workers in Ghana have to adopt strategies that are relevant for their socio-cultural context. Nonetheless, it remains unclear how social workers are implementing culturally sensitive social work approaches. This research investigated the various strategies that social workers have used in implementing culturally sensitive social work approaches. It has been revealed that in a bid to make their practice and education culturally sensitive, social work educators make use of local wise sayings, cases and examples, while practitioners were found to rely a lot on family dispute resolution strategies as well as the traditional authority system as part of practice techniques. This research argues that the emphasis of a culturally sensitive social work approach must be on teaching practitioners and educators how to negotiate the demands of culture, social work values, ethics and constitutional law and secondly, for educators to develop an understanding of their context and to use that understanding to explain social work concepts in a way that students can identify with.",

Outcomes included teachers’ professional well-being and classroom practices. Most gains observed during the program year faded out. However, there were small sustained impacts on the implementation of training activities. Counteracting effects of the parental-awareness meetings were evident, with suggestive evidence that teachers in this treatment group displayed lower scores on one dimension of classroom quality—Supporting Student Expression—compared to controls.

    "Abstract (AB)": "We examine second-year impacts of a 1-year pre-primary teacher training and coaching program, delivered with and without parental-awareness meetings, evaluated with a school-level randomized trial. Outcomes included teachers' professional well-being and classroom practices. Most gains observed during the program year faded out. However, there were small sustained impacts on the implementation of training activities. Counteracting effects of the parental-awareness meetings were evident, with suggestive evidence that teachers in this treatment group displayed lower scores on one dimension of classroom quality-Supporting Student Expression-compared to controls. Implications for professional development and educational quality are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\\n",

In low- and middle-income countries, cascade models of teacher professional development are often used as routes to educational reform. In these models, external agents deliver professional development, which is then disseminated by in-country facilitators. However, little is known about how to support facilitators of professional development, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. In this study, we report on a model of capacity building for professional development in Ghana. In the context of a large-scale programme of science teacher professional development, a group of Ghanaian teachers gradually assumed responsibility for professional development facilitation, working alongside experienced facilitators from the UK. Using interviews focussed on a storyline technique, we explore the experiences of the Ghanaian teachers as they reflected on their roles. We found the teachers’ epistemological beliefs about teaching were coherent with those of the programme and suggest that this may be an important factor in the success of cascade models of professional development. The teachers gained self-confidence and improved their knowledge and skills of teaching and of professional development facilitation. We propose that this is useful learning for all facilitators and that the model described here is one which is potentially useful for capacity building in other contexts.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Background. Malaria is no doubt a burden on both the financial and human resources of Ghana. In this study, we examined the awareness of malaria prevention practices among indigenes of Godokpe, a rural community in the Ho Municipality of Ghana. Methods. This descriptive cross-sectional survey that used a self-developed questionnaire recruited 246 residents of Godokpe who were aged 18 years and above using a systematic sampling technique. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to analyze data into descriptive and analytical statistics. The descriptive statistics comprised frequency, percentage, and means. Also, analytical statistics of cross tabulation was conducted considering a p<0.05 at a 95% Confidence Interval to be statistically significant. Findings. About 54% and 20% of the respondents, respectively, had satisfactory and good levels of knowledge on malaria prevention. The methods used in malaria prevention included mosquito coils (72%), cleaning and prevention of water stagnation (62%), mosquito spray (54%), and mosquito net (59%). Also, malaria treatment methods mostly used were quinine (70%) and chloroquine (50.4%). The major sources of information on malaria were television (74%), health professionals (66%), schools (62%), family/friends (60%), and the Internet (51%). Conclusion. School children showed good understanding of malaria and its vectors. There is, therefore, the need to increase the empowerment of teachers with appropriate health information including malaria so that they can continue to deliver malaria information to the pupils.",

The total study sample comprised 18,420 pupils involving 9,764 primary grade 3 pupils and 8,656 primary grade 6 pupils, drawn from 265 and 250 schools respectively. The weighted sample equivalents are 284,404 and 252,235 for primary grade 3 and primary grade 6 pupils respectively. The bio-ecological systems theory and the psychological theory of educational productivity were adapted to model the connections between specific variables in the dataset and educational achievement. Data were analysed using independent-samples t-test, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, hierarchical multiple regression and multilevel modelling techniques. There were statistically significant differences in the achievement of boys and girls at both grade levels. With the exception of primary grade 3 English Language achievement, boys outperformed girls in the remaining subjects. A statistically significant positive relationship was found between primary grade 3 pupils' age and achievement in both subjects whereas a statistically significant negative relationship was found for the primary grade 6 sample. Of the variables explored, the type of school a pupil attended had the largest impact on achievement; achievement by private school pupils was significantly higher than public school pupils. Using pupils' academic achievement as a measure, qualified teachers were found to be significantly more effective than unqualified teachers. Teaching experience was found to be statistically significant for primary grade 6 English Language achievement only. The location of schools was also found to be an important determinant of pupils' levels of academic achievem Urban school pupils did significantly better than those from rural schools. Finally, the academic achievement by pupils from schools in deprived districts was significantly lower than those from endowed districts. These findings have implications for the Government of Ghana. They suggest the need for pupils to be enrolled in schools at the expected age while at the same time training more qualified teachers. It also suggested that Continuous Professional Development opportunities be created for the unqualified teachers to upgrade their knowledge and skills. The findings also suggest that any attempts at improving pupils' learning and achievement would require adequate resourcing of rural schools and deprived districts in particular. The successful utilisation of secondary data in this study affirms the importance of this type of data for further studies including testing the applicability of existing theories such as the bio-ecological systems theory and the psychological theory of educational productivity in different contexts.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "This study investigates how pedagogical, cultural and institutional factors interact with technical knowledge in educational technology integration and how they relate to equitable and effective technology use in low-resource settings. In the context of a one-to-one tablet initiative in rural Kenya, we explore how these factors constrain or support access to technology, instructor's capacity, student's engagement and student's learning, as well as their implications for reducing educational and digital divides. We employ mixed methods, such as a quasi-experimental (prepost, nonequivalent control group) research design that draws the data from classroom observations, teacher's interviews, student's surveys and focus groups and assessments of student's academic performance to generate evidence on classroom practices and student's learning in schools with access to tablets, while also highlighting core challenges to successful technology integration. Our findings contribute to the identification of prerequisites and supporting factors for the successful educational technology integration, as well as policy levers and school-based strategies that are likely to increase equitable access to quality learning experiences in schools in low-resource contexts. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic A lack of funding, planning and infrastructure hinder information and communication technology (ICT) integration. Procurement of educational technology and infrastructure improvement efforts have reduced digital divides, but learning divides persist in implementation. Insufficient teacher technology expertise and professional development constrain teacher's effective use of educational technology in classrooms. What this paper adds We employ mixed methods-triangulating the student's assessment data with data from student's surveys and focus groups, teacher's interviews and classroom observations-to identify how pedagogical, cultural and institutional factors interact with technical knowledge in ICT integration in ways that support or constrain student's learning in low-resource contexts. We find that more attention is needed for cultural factors that interact with pedagogical and technical skills to ensure that the classroom instructors' attention is equitability distributed in ways that discourage in-class \"tracking\" and differential access to quality learning experiences, such as some teachers' disregard of \"slow learners\" in the classroom. In low-resource contexts, providing even basic levels of infrastructure (eg, a consistent power source) and access to general technical knowledge requires more creative and concerted efforts from school leadership and instructors, such as the offer of tutorials and reading clubs outside of the class to expand the access and improve the use of devices. Implications for practice and/or policy We find that device sharing can have positive effects on peer-to-peer learning, which suggests that policymakers in Kenya should weigh the benefits of achieving one-to-one device access against the potential advantages of alternative investments, such as expanding professional development on the integration and use of currently available devices. Increasing opportunities for peer-to-peer learning and exchange (among teachers and students) and building shared capacities for ICT integration can help reduce technical issues and lost instructional time.\\n",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Most efforts to improve school settings and increase student learning assume adequately trained and knowledgeable teachers with the personal capacity and professional support to effectively implement new programs. This is unlikely to be true in under-resourced communities where teachers face a range of personal and professional barriers to effective teaching. This dissertation presents a framework for re-conceptualizing the role of teachers' lives, characteristics, well-being, and contexts toward the goal of more effective education for children growing up in challenging settings. It then examines this framework through a close look at one particular educational intervention: a teacher training program for early childhood education (ECE) teachers in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana.    Paper 1 highlights the breadth of possible supports and barriers teachers face – teachers' lives in context – and how these influence their attendance, attrition, and pedagogical quality within under-resourced settings. Paper 2 describes the conditions of ECE teachers in six disadvantaged districts of Greater Accra and how these conditions relate to teacher attrition, take-up of the training, and observed adherence to and quality of implementation of training materials. Paper 3, using a novel approach to reducing researcher degrees of freedom, tests the causal moderation of teacher training on classroom processes and student learning by teachers' lives in context.    Findings indicate that ECE teachers in this setting face a wide range of barriers to high quality teaching at multiple levels of the bioecological model and that many of these relate to their responsiveness to the training. Low job satisfaction predicts increased attrition; depression predicts decreased take-up; seniority and poverty risks predict decreased adherence; many time demand barriers predicts increased adherence and implementation quality; and secondary degrees and prior early childhood development training predict increased implementation quality, as does take-up. Some of these barriers influence the effectiveness of the training program. Specifically, the training impacts classroom processes for teachers with secondary degrees but not without and student learning outcomes for those with more contextual barriers than average.    This work contributes to a more complete, nuanced understanding of teachers, the barriers they face, and how to support them to strengthen classrooms and advance student learning in under-resourced communities.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "The study primarily explored the challenges of teaching in rural basic schools in Ghana. Qualitative research method through semi-structured interviews and document analyses were used as data collection instruments. The participants for the study included six educational field workers which constituted a district education officer (Circuit Supervisor), two head teachers and three classroom teachers. Priority of the findings was highlighted on the provision of accommodation with adequate installation of lighting facility, potable drinking water, and transport facilities such as a vehicle, motorbike and bicycle to ease the living constraints of teachers who serve in underprivileged learning communities. Again, professional development programs were found relevant to encourage and promote teachers working in remote areas. Results of the study shown that rural basic school teachers do not see why they should receive equivalent conditions of service as their peers who teach in urban schools. It is therefore recommended that, about one-third of teachers? salary should be apportioned as additional incentive to motivate teachers who serve in rural basic schools. Again, special student-trainees recruitment strategies should be adopted to recruit potential teachers from underprivileged communities to receive training and serve their people. This can effectively be implemented when the District Sponsorship Scheme Project is restored to enhance better deployment of teachers in underserved schools.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "© The Author(s) 2019. The concepts of ‘leadership’ and ‘inclusion’ continue to attract much attention in educational discourses; however, not many studies have explored their connection in schools serving conflict-affected communities where displacement and fragmentation of families risks the access, participation and achievement of many young people in education. This single intrinsic case study with aspects of ethnography was conducted in one post-conflict community primary school in Kenya, following the 2007/8 post-election violence. Overall, the aim was to understand the connection between school leadership and inclusive education practices, with interest in the schooling experiences of conflict-affected children. Following an integration of reviewed literature and findings emerging from the entire study, this paper specifically examines how roles for school leadership can be understood in relation to developing inclusive practices for conflict-affected pupils in post-conflict schooling. Three core thematic issues emerged, suggesting that these roles involved: mediating ‘post-conflict conflicts’; fostering ‘socio-moral connectedness’, and engendering aspects of ‘indigenous leadership practice’ in school. These roles were fundamental in reversing community disintegration and repairing moral distortion. Besides contributing to knowledge in the developing field of education and conflict, this study highlights the joint social, moral and professional investment made by headteachers and teachers in repairing violence-torn societies.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Vocational and Technical Education forms a very key foundation in enabling a nation to achieve aspired MDGs and SDG. Kenya as a country highly depends on technical skills to achieve The Vision 2030 and Sustainable Development Goals. However, this can only be achieved through proper and realistic career counseling information provided by the counseling teachers at secondary school level. According to KCSE results released every year, majority of the candidates score below grade C+ especially in 2016 and 2017 though above D- which is the requirements for entrance for proficiency level for TVET courses. However, majority of students do not join Vocational or Technical Education due to a missing link between the natures of career counseling services offered at secondary school level. Counselors has expectations and premise that majority of the candidates join trainings at university levels thus package their counseling information on the few ignoring other students. The objective behind this study was to examine the final results scored by students and the subject choice at secondary school, various career theories and models that guide career choices formed foundation for the study. The study used a descriptive design where data was collected through past existing data review from KNEC and one Technical Training Institute over a period of four years. Data was analyzed and presented in tables and figures. Findings revealed that majority of the candidates (86.92%) of the KCPE candidates scored less than C+ and had no career information on Vocational and Technical Education. The study recommends reengineering of the career guidance in Kenya education system to involve the Ministry, professionals and Human Resource Management experts.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "© 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to review the findings from a study of teacher professional learning networks in Kenya. Specific areas of focus included network participation, network activities, network leadership, and professional impact on network members and their schools. Design/methodology/approach: The research was grounded in the literature on education networks and teacher learning. The research employed a qualitative design and was implemented from September 2015–March 2017, including three two-week field trips to Kenya. Data included network records, 83 personal interviews, 4 focus group interviews, 19 observations of network meetings, and classroom observation of network and non-network teachers in 12 schools. Findings: Network participation had positive effects on teachers’ sense of professionalism and commitment to teaching and on their attitudes toward ongoing professional learning and improvement in student learning. Teachers also highlighted network benefits for learning to use new teaching strategies and materials, responding to student misbehavior and misunderstanding, and lesson preparation. Research limitations/implications: Research constraints did not permit longitudinal investigation of network activities and outcomes. Practical implications: The paper identifies challenges and potential focuses for strengthening the learning potential of network activities, network leadership, and the links between network activity and school improvement. Originality/value: Prior research has investigated education networks mostly in North American and similar high income settings. This paper highlights the benefits and challenges for networks as a strategy for continuous teacher development in a low income low resource capacity context.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to review the findings from a study of teacher professional learning networks in Kenya. Specific areas of focus included network participation, network activities, network leadership, and professional impact on network members and their schools.\\nDesign/methodology/approach - The research was grounded in the literature on education networks and teacher learning. The research employed a qualitative design and was implemented from September 2015-March 2017, including three two-week field trips to Kenya. Data included network records, 83 personal interviews, 4 focus group interviews, 19 observations of network meetings, and classroom observation of network and non-network teachers in 12 schools.\\nFindings - Network participation had positive effects on teachers' sense of professionalism and commitment to teaching and on their attitudes toward ongoing professional learning and improvement in student learning. Teachers also highlighted network benefits for learning to use new teaching strategies and materials, responding to student misbehavior and misunderstanding, and lesson preparation.\\nResearch limitations/implications - Research constraints did not permit longitudinal investigation of network activities and outcomes.\\nPractical implications - The paper identifies challenges and potential focuses for strengthening the learning potential of network activities, network leadership, and the links between network activity and school improvement.\\nOriginality/value - Prior research has investigated education networks mostly in North American and similar high income settings. This paper highlights the benefits and challenges for networks as a strategy for continuous teacher development in a low income low resource capacity context.\\n",

However, a key challenge in bringing about desired improvements lies in the lack of context-specific understanding of teaching practices and meaningful ways of supporting teacher professional development. This paper focuses on the need to measure the social quality of teaching processes in a contextualized manner. We do so by highlighting the efforts made to develop and measure teacher practices and classroom processes using the Teacher Instructional Practices and Processes System© (TIPPS) in three different contexts: Uganda (secondary), India (primary), and Ghana (pre-school). By examining how such a tool can be used for teacher feedback, reflective practice, and continuous improvement, the hope is to pave the way toward enhanced 21st-century teacher skills and, in turn, 21st-century learners.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "Vocational and Technical Education forms a very key foundation in enabling a nation to achieve aspired MDGs and SDG. Kenya as a country highly depends on technical skills to achieve the Vision 2030 and Sustainable Development Goals. However, this can only be achieved through proper and realistic career counseling information provided by the counseling teachers at the secondary school level. According to KCSE results released every year, the majority of the candidates score below grade C+ especially in 2016 and 2017 though above D- which is the requirement for entrance for proficiency level for TVET courses.  However, the majority of students do not join Vocational or Technical Education due to a missing link between the natures of career counseling services offered at the secondary school level. Counselors have expectations and premise that the majority of the candidates join training at university levels thus package their counseling information on the few ignoring other students.  The objective behind this study was to examine the final results scored by students and the subject choice at secondary school, various career theories, and models that guide career choices formed the foundation for the study. The study used a descriptive design where data was collected through past existing data review from KNEC and one Technical Training Institute over a period of four years. Data was analyzed and presented in tables and figures. Findings revealed that the majority of the candidates (86.92%) of the KCPE candidates scored less than C+ and had no career information on Vocational and Technical Education. The study recommends reengineering of the career guidance in Kenya education system to involve the Ministry, professionals and Human Resource Management experts.",

    "Abstract (AB)": "© 2019 Society for Community Research and Action This study explores the personal, professional, and contextual conditions faced by early childhood education (ECE) teachers in under-resourced settings and how these relate to teacher responsiveness to professional development (PD): namely, teacher attrition (a sign of PD failure when occurring shortly after PD), take-up of offered PD, adherence to PD training/materials, and quality of implementation. We use data from six disadvantaged districts in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana and PD focused on implementation of a national, play-based curriculum. Descriptive statistics indicate that ECE teachers (n = 302) face a multitude of barriers to high quality teaching across the bioecological model. Multilevel mixed effects models find that teachers with low job satisfaction are more likely to leave the school within the academic year. Teachers with moderate to severe depression are less likely to attend PD trainings. Senior teachers and those with poverty risks are less likely to adhere to PD material. Teachers with many time demand barriers are more likely to adhere to material. They also implement the content at higher observed quality as do teachers with bachelor's degrees and early childhood development (ECD) training. Take-up of PD also predicts quality of implementation. Practice and research implications are discussed.",
